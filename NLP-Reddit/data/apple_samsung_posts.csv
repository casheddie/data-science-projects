Thoroughly disappointed in the way Samsung handled the S10's Beta program,0,dixqwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/dixqwb/thoroughly_disappointed_in_the_way_samsung/,11,"I own the S10+ Snapdragon Unlocked version. The SM-G975U1 to be more precise.

I bought this phone although I don't live in the states in hope of actually getting a better experience than I would have had with the exynos version. (bad past memories) I was hoping to get a better package and it turned out way better than expected seeing all the issues that rose on team exy's side.

The beta came... I had the pop up in the app, I was registering and nothing was happening. I was told to wait a sec, a minute,  15 minutes and then a full day. Nothing happened and the bar just disappeared.

I love betas because I can give coherent explanations of what I would be going through to achieve said bugs. I could not get in. And now I have to wait for somebody to build an update.zip file for the g975U1 and afterwards, I won't be able to report bugs because Samsung cares about only those who are selected, not all the beta users.

Such a let down. Last year I couldn't get in the beta with my exynos s9 and I promised myself I could do it this year... 

TL;DR: I had the opportunity to get in the beta. Beta registration did not work no matter what I did/tried. Disappointed as I was ready to beta test the sh*t out of the OS.",1571297131.0,0

Thinking of leaving Android + Windows,37,dinmpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/dinmpx/thinking_of_leaving_android_windows/,43,"Every day I'm thinking more and more about leaving Android + Windows and just getting a Macbook and iPhone. While I've been thinking about this, the Google event yesterday kind of gave me an additional push.

Google and Apple seem to be going in two different directions, and I'm starting to agree more with what Apple is doing. Watching the event yesterday, I frequently asked myself, ""who actually wants this?""

For example, the hand gestures. Who ACTUALLY wants that? Why was so much time wasted on R&D for this feature when:

1. It has already existed for a long time
2. There is virtually no demand for it

It reminded me of Android 10's new ""desktop mode"" as well. This is something that even non-Google companies have been trying to implement (e.g. Samsung Dex). The idea is that we would have either 1 device we use for everything, or seamless syncing of devices like the Apple ecosystem. So Google has the opportunity to steamroll the market and create this ""desktop mode"" that will essentially turn their phones into an all-in-one device, and instead, they release some garbage alpha version that needs developer options toggled just to use semi-properly.

At first I thought that perhaps 1 device would be superior, but now I'm leaning more towards the ecosystem being better. Especially considering the new changes Apple has been making, where developers can actually make apps that work on iPhone, iPad, AND Mac from one code base.

Another thing is privacy. Look at all of those new google devices that are going to be listening in on EVERYTHING you say. At first you might think, ""wow, this is convenient!"" and shortly after you think ""wait, so I'm literally being listened to 24/7?""

It just seems like Apple is starting to give people what they actually want and use while maintaining a strong sense of privacy. Google is just throwing shit at a wall and hoping some of it sticks. It makes me wonder - how many people at Google actually use iPhones instead of Pixels? Like, do people who create these products actually USE them?

I might just go to Best Buy today or tomorrow and drop $5k to see if I'm right about my feelings. I'm posting this here to see if anyone has switched over to Apple and had a similar experience/thought process.",1571252229.0,1
"TIL Because iPhones shoot photos in HEIC format and not JPG, you get free unlimited original quality backups to Google Photos due to HEIC being smaller and more efficient than JPG so Google doesn’t touch the files.",633,dio8w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/dio8w4/til_because_iphones_shoot_photos_in_heic_format/,118,"With all modern iPhones shooting photos in HEIC format, which is smaller than even Googles compressed JPG files, iPhones therefore get free unlimited ORIGINAL quality backups simply because it would cost Google both storage space (because if Google tried to compress iPhones HEIC photos they would actually become larger) and computing power (because Google doesn’t need to compress and process all of the billions of photos iPhones backup.)

I am looking to upgrade my current truly wireless earbuds, and am considering the Samsung Buds as one of my options. However my experience with the Icon X was fairly negative. I had severe connectivity issues even with a Samsung phone (Note 9) 

The biggest issue I experienceed was one earbud or the other desyncing from my phone. I also had the earbuds volume setting desyncing from each other, and playing content at wildly different volumes (one being normal and the other barely audible). I had a few other issues, but these two were pretty much deal breakers and killed the product for me. None of the troubleshooting guidelines, cleaning with alcohol, or resetting worked for the long term. 

So my main question here is if anyone has experenced any issues with their Buds, specifically in regards to connectivity. The sub and critics as a whole seem fairly positive on them, and I throughly enjoy the Samsung ecosystem. So they are a strong contender for the upgrade.",1571269573.0,0

I'm currently in search of a laptop or a laptop replacement, such as a Tab S6 in DeX mode or the Surface Pro X. However, the Galaxy Book S is price-wise between the aforementioned devices and would really be ideal. I really don't wanna buy another overheating dusty mess with an x86 CPU - I'm tired of thermal issues and really sub-par battery life and buying an Intel or AMD-powered laptop would be a sidegrade for me.

However, since Unpacked in August, where it was said it was gonna launch in September, I've not heard anything about the Galaxy Book S release date. Am I wrong or has there been any news of release?

With regards to the ""always-connected"" thing, do I really need to get a SIM card to use the laptop? If it's optional, then great, but to buy a laptop for a grand and then still *have to* buy a separate data plan is simply a backwards step to me.",1571253784.0,0

Weird Apple Card Fail,8,diejh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/diejh5/weird_apple_card_fail/,16,"Wanted to share my negative experience with Apple Card for folks considering it.

 TLDR: Apple Card unlike any credit card out there requires a ""purchase history of small amounts"" before it will accept transactions over >$500. 

More detailed summary:

* I wanted to buy \~$3500 of Apple hardware for the house at an Apple Store.
* I got Apple card a few weeks ago and I want to take advantage of the 3% cash-back. I only use it for App Store and Uber.
* When I tried the big purchase using Apple Pay in the Apple Store, it was declining. I had plenty of credit left on the card and the Apple rep even split the payment. The result was always ""bank declining.""

The Apple Rep suggested a support chat while in the store. Will skip the details and just move to the conclusion

* The support rep made dozens of grammatical errors. And sent few messages with long pauses. The entire chat was >45 minutes. Overall really unprofessional, much worse than any other bank. 
* They could not get Apple Pay /w Apple Card to work. The Apple Store rep suggested manually entering the card number into the terminal and then everything worked. 
* Apple Card support said that I ""must"" have a bigger purchase history with Apple Card before it would ""allow"" large transactions. They verbatim asked me to buy more so that I can buy more.",1571202684.0,1
Honestly I think Apples repair center is a lawsuit waiting to happen,0,did0bo,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/did0bo/honestly_i_think_apples_repair_center_is_a/,72,"I resell phones for a side business. Part of the game is buying devices that may be under some sort of repair program or warranty that the owner may not be fully aware of or not care about much, sending to Apple, and getting them repaired. Nothing against their policy.

My friends and I do this and know others in the game. The goal is to go into the store and try to get the replacement same day, but the store has a system that randomly flags devices for depot (nothing you can do, managers supposedly can override it but only for a very good reason). Even if you have AppleCare, they still might flag for depot. 

This leaves only one option - to send to one of Apple’s repair depot. 

These places are a hit or miss. My friends and I all have examples where the depot broke something, deny the repair and accuse the customer of breaking it, or accuse the customer of altering the device in some way. 

 I have friends that work for AppleCare and they can attest, they’ve seen this happen plenty of times. What’s even worse is Apple will refuse to service no matter how much you bark at them in most cases.

The reason this is a lawsuit waiting to happen is because recently they’ve started flagging for depot more frequently. Nearly every device unless it’s something like a battery or screen repair. They claim it’s so that their “engineers can capture data and ensure everything in the phone is genuine” which is kind of a slap in the face to the customer experience. Data can be captured without sending the device in.

Really bad Genius Bar experience - Am I doing any wrong here?,15,dibhdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/dibhdp/really_bad_genius_bar_experience_am_i_doing_any/,19,"I had a really bad experience dealing with those ""Genius"" today. I wanted to post my experience and let you judge... Please pardon for my poor English.

I went to an Apple Store today for this replacement program (https://support.apple.com/three-prong-ac-wall-plug-adapter) today. I have two of those, both of them came with Mac I bought before in HK and have no Apple logo on it.

The first Genius (Mike) checked those duckheads and told me they're not from Apple because they don't have Apple logo on it.  The first thought came to my mind was: well, maybe I was wrong about where did I get those. Fine. 

Then I did a little bit searches of the prints of those duckheads, one of those has ""Volex AP13D"" and some voltage info on it, then ""BS 5733/A"" (which is I think is UK plug standard); the other one has ""WELL SHIN WS-086-4"" on first line, the rest is pretty much all same as the Volex one. I figured about both Volex and Well Shin are manufacturer of Apple products. 

Then I went back to the store, and another Genius came (I forgot his name). I showed the picture on the replacement program webpage to him (the one under title ""Affected""), if you look really closely into that pic, it has ""Volex AP13D"" wording on it. I said Mike was wrong about it. Both of those are genuine Apple duckheads. He checked again, admitted the Volex one is real, but said the Well Shin is a third party one so he couldn't service it. 

This really pissed me off. I explained to him there are many manufacturers producing products for Apple, it's not necessarily only the one shown in picture is affected. If there's any limitation or the replacement program is only applied to any specific products/manufacturers, Apple would say it in the support article (see this: https://support.apple.com/ac-wallplug-adapter). We had a good argue about this, and finally he agreed to replace the ""Well Shin"" one because of ""goodwill"" and ""want to keep their customers safe""! I thanked him and left the store.

I came back home, and found out on this page (https://support.apple.com/ac-wallplug-adapter), Well Shin is shown on the duckhead on the pic below ""Affected"". I should've shown this to the genius...

Ok, now my question is: since when the Apple support starts to question their customers before even check with their internal docs, and even lying to their customers when they know nothing about it? I don't why this happens, but Apple should really train these ""Genius"" better... 

And finally, the second genius seemed not quite happy with me when I left the store. He might think I'm a scammer and wanted to trick Apple's support system... Did I do anything wrong here?

Apple's Dark Mode Sucks,0,didw5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/didw5t/apples_dark_mode_sucks/,31,"This is coming from a guy that runs a lot of stuff in dark mode. And when I say Apple's Dark Mode sucks, I mean it's visually jarring. It's amazing that the UI designers allowed this to even get out into public. They literally just inverted the colors and called it a day without accounting into contrast and how menus and windows work or even how certain colors just don't work on a black background.

Dark mode doesn't mean just slap a black background and call it a day. There are varying degrees of dark mode. Adobe and Discord know this. Which is why their backgrounds aren't completely black, but more 80% Gray. Even Adobe gives you a slider to adjust how dark your dark mode is.

With all the amazing attention to detail that Apple has done in the past, this seems like they're just dropping the ball. The iOS dark mode is not as bad as the MacOS. Probably because there aren't overlapping windows to deal with. Mail in dark mode is especially bad.

One UI 2 animations,10,dic8x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/dic8x1/one_ui_2_animations/,4,"I love the new animations but I wish Samsung would just fix this one little thing about them. Everytime you close an app with the new gestures, the app screen disappears slowly as it gets smaller and the app icon appears, right? Now the app icon is a rounded square whereas the app screen is if course tall. So when it transitions from the app screen to the app icon, it looks kinda choppy. Apple solved this by just making the app icon taller and it gets back to it's normal form, once it reaches its place. Looks way smoother for sure. If y'all have the beta, please suggest this because I feel like Samsung could work on this since it's nothing big. Just make the app icon taller (lengthen the app icon at the bottom essentially) and make it progressively shorter.",1571193486.0,0

A warning to people - Pretty sure Samsung just tricked me into making/reactivating a dead Samsung Cloud account. Not cool.,0,di36b3,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/di36b3/a_warning_to_people_pretty_sure_samsung_just/,11,"Just got an email claiming that my Samsung Cloud account was about to have its contents deleted for inactivity. Stated the data would be deleted on 12/14/19 as that is the day I would have been inactive for 12 months which doesn't make sense. A little worried I went and signed in to the account, putting in a password I think might have been one I usually used back when I still had Samsung products years ago. It let me in but stated my account was based on a google account and I'd need to create a new password. What? 

Now I haven't owned a Samsung device in years, and certainly never used the Samsung cloud as I use Google Drive. Lo and behold everything is empty and the only listed devices are my Galaxy Tab 10.1 last used April 2012 (lol), Tab S2 last used October 2015, and a Note 5 (my last Samsung device) last used Feb 2016. Searched my email and found nothing about new logins, although I was sent one about this login, so assuming if someone had hijacked my account last year either their device would show up or I would have received an email about a web login.

I think this was ultimately an ""advertisement"" where they make you worry about a dead and long defunct account created by proxy of owning a Samsung device so you go log in and are reminded of it and their products existence. I can't personally think of any alternatives but am open to hearing about why this may have happened. At any rate, account deleted and mind reminded as to one of the many reasons why I don't use ANY Samsung products anymore and haven't for years.",1571145823.0,0

Now its happening again and im getting sick of doing this. Apps take a long while to launch, camera takes longer to take photos and when I stop recording a video it hangs when I hit stop and doesn't recover until I force the app to close. It saves the video but this is a massive inconvenience. It's due now again for another reset but I don't want to do it because I'll have to reinstall everything.

Wifi acting weird on Galaxy S10+,2,di2sbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/di2sbb/wifi_acting_weird_on_galaxy_s10/,4,"Have recently got an s10+, and to my surprise, the wifi range is ""worse"" than my last phone, iphone 6s (ironic how the 6s has one of the worse wifi capabilities)

Although my last phone should have a worse wifi than the s10+, it could always pickup and connect to the wifi at Place B without any issues. Having said that im certain that its not some sort of problem with my router/its range.

Also, her 2FA is asking for old CC info of a card she doesn’t have anymore...so that’s great

Talking to Apple, her account is now in recovery. Took 7 days for them to call her, after an hour long phone call they tell her she will get another call in 2 weeks...2 WEEKS!

What the fuck is the point of this? It’s not uncommon to have to reset a password, why is this so difficult? Looking around online shows a bunch of pissed off customers in the same situation. Some just ignored and never resolved.

S10+ not receiving & sending calls. Software up to date.,3,dhjdg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/dhjdg3/s10_not_receiving_sending_calls_software_up_to/,4,"Hoping to get some help here... I've been having issues with not being able to send and receive both calls and texts.



When trying to call out within the past couple of months it will kind of just hang there in dead space, not dial out but says ""connecting"" so I hang up, power down, restart and try again and it works fine.



Within the past month or so four people have told me they called but on my end the phone didn't ring and didn't show any missed calls.  


Text messages have always shown as ""failed"" when my contacts have received them (happened on my S6+ but not at all as often since it was released until I got the new S10+ model in March 2019) when every single day on the S10 they show as failed so I just learned to disregard that.  Also, it always seems to deliver them out of order as in someone is replying to the 3rd text that was delivered while the last (5th) text (with the same amount of characters) sent still shows as ""sending"" so they haven't received it yet and are replying to the middle of what I was saying thinking it was the end - can be confusing for recipients and probably confusing to people reading this (apologies if so).



System update shows it's up to date, ""software updated to G975USQS2BS14 on Sept 18, 2019 at 5:32am"".  I haven't downloaded any apps since August and never download anything on the phone unless it's a silly meme or something that I save to my photos.  I live and work in an area with great cell coverage so it's not like the phone is reaching for connection in splotchy coverage areas. At work I stay off the wifi if chatting online for a few reasons but mostly because it's slower and I don't want to hold it up for others or be held up by too many people on the wifi since I already have issues with receiving and sending messages.


Just trying to figure out if I might have inadvertently selected a setting that blocks receiving calls from unidentified numbers (two of the calls I missed were from doctors who usually don't call me) or if there's something wrong with this model of phone since it has had issues since I got it or of if I inadvertently messed something up in the settings altogether or if something messed up in it with my settings after the system update (this started a couple of weeks before the system update) and if I'm using a bad text platform (there were two to chose from as I recall when I started using the phone).  


Or if the problems are with my cell carrier, Verizon.

An S10 is something I was thinking about but one thing I've heard about / experienced(current phone is LG) with non Google phones is that most companies tend to be pretty slow on updating their phones; that being said, for all the long-time Galaxy / Note owners - how has Samsung been with regards to things like security updates?

Feature updates would be great... but honestly that's less important than having security updates delivered in a reasonably timely fashion.

&#x200B;

As a side note - I was considering an iPhone 11 too, given the new cameras + added battery life + being able to trade in an old testing device, I'm pretty certain I'll end up sticking with Android but if anyone had thoughts on that, that'd be great to hear too.

Check this out!! If anyone hasn’t watched this yet, it’s worth watching. Jason in the video is just stating one truth after another. The funniest thing he said is “Tim Cock,” which was on accident of course lmaoooo

But he really thinks Tim should be fired. I agree with his points about the lack of innovation. They hid that behind the upgraded camera system. The camera upgrade is indeed awesome. Battery life too. That’s why I upgraded from the X. But he brought up the point of innovation now vs when Jobs was in charge. 

The first iPhone. I remember the keynote. Everyone was blown away by what it could do. 

Then comes the iPhone 4 with a completely upgraded design. iPhone 4s, Siri. People were blown away by that too. Then Touch ID. Then the introduction to the 5.5 Plus model iPhone 6. Then 3D Touch. I agree with Jason that innovation took a big step back after that.

The iPhone X was a big change but they kept the same design and didn’t even implement dark mode to take advantage of the OLED. They didn’t even do it in iOS 12. Users had to beg and beg for it and we finally got it in iOS 13. Then ultra wide camera. Apple is in last place for it. It’s great, I’ll give them that but I was hoping to see it in the Xs, which was a very disappointing update from the X. Many are quite disappointed with the iPad 10.2 from the 6th gen and the new iPhones. I have to say I love the changes from the X I had but the only difference is the camera and battery life. No... I’m sorry. They removed 3D Touch. I don’t like that. Just because many didn’t use it doesn’t make it right to remove it. I loved it but I’ve adapted to Haptic. Doesn’t mean I like it more. But everything else is the exact same. I would have LOVED if they brought back the iPhone 4 design with the 11, Pro and Max. It is their best iPhone design, IMO. The glass back was beautiful but easily breakable. There is a SLIGHT chance we’ll get it back in 2021. Plus no 5G while others companies are implementing it in their flagship phones now and 5G is already being implemented in parts of the US. Carriers would make more money if they included it but they didn’t. It would make the purchase more justifiable. 

Someone else on there mentioned the camera can only be so good and we’re very close to that. What is Apple going to do then? Touch ID on the screen? There aren’t many who want that. After that, then what? Reverse wireless charging doesn’t seem appealing as all its going to do is drain the battery. iPad is different. They’ve made decent updates with that but that’s not their main selling product. 

These new media services are going to fail. Someone else mentioned there’s no value in it. Disney is going to destroy Apple’s media service, quick. Netflix is even in danger with Disney’s upcoming release. 

Sorry for the long post but I LOVED what they brought up cause some I didn’t even think about.

"[Self-Promotion Saturday] Introducing Entropy, the random episode generator built for iOS and TV fanatics like you.",20,dgwani,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/dgwani/selfpromotion_saturday_introducing_entropy_the/,2,"Hello!

TLDR: 
For just over a year, now, I've been developing an app to help you pick an episode of your favorite TV show, and I've just released it for completely free. Entropy for iOS is the best way to begin watching, fast. 

Download Link: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/entropy-for-ios/id1459682815?ls=1

#**Detailed Description**

We've all been there. You've got exactly 25 minutes before you have to leave for that really important thing. Exactly enough time for an episode of your favorite show. Problem is, how are you supposed to use that time efficiently if you have to find an episode to watch? 

-

*this is where Entropy comes in, wow*

-

Entropy is designed to get you watching faster. Waste less time picking an episode so you can spend more time watching! Just pick one of Entropy's **twelve** shows ^(with 4 more on the way soon and taking requests) and Entropy does the rest.

###A few of my favorite features:

- You can pick out the shows you watch and rearrange them however you'd like
- After you've picked an episode, you can swipe down on the title to do one of two things:
       - Bring up more episode info including description, ratings, and duration. * 
       - Perform a Google Search for the episode. Google's ""Watch Episode"" tab gives you direct links to the episode on your favorite streaming platforms. ** 
- Shake your device (or tap the logo at the top of the screen) to pick an episode from any of your selected shows. Let Entropy pick the show too!
- Add episodes to your Favorites and then you can pick just from your favorite episodes!
- Built into iOS with 3D (or Haptic) Touch actions, Search results, and a URL scheme. All of these can be used to get an episode immediately from outside the app (though it does send you into the app)! I'll be making an addition to the app's site with details on the URL scheme soon!

#####The rest of the notable features:

- Pick which season to watch from! The Season Picker will tell Entropy to only pick episodes from the selected season.
- A built-in Random Number Generator for your convenience!
- A directory of every episode Entropy can generate! From here you can favorite episodes and hold down on the title to bring up more episode info as mentioned earlier! 
       - (some episodes look like they're skipped when they're part of another but this is intentional, ex. episode 1-3 looks like episode 1 and then the list skips to 4)
- Filter only by Halloween or Christmas episodes!
- Custom app icons! Currently, there are 13 icons and more coming soon with updates! If there's a particular color scheme or theme you'd like me to get an icon for, feel free to send me the request! :) 

I encourage you to check out the app for yourself. It may come in handy quite a bit! If you have any questions at all please feel free to ask them below!

\* This episode information is provided by a third-party service and 1) may prove unreliable if the app reaches a large audience and 2) doesn't have information for every episode in Entropy. I hope to find a workaround for this in the future but other than that, this feature is pretty cool.

** Google's database doesn't always get the right episode because sometimes the numbers mismatch. If this happens, the episode is usually pretty close to the incorrect one. I do intend to fix this in the future.",1570921498.0,1

Samsung has let me down,0,dgv0w2,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/dgv0w2/samsung_has_let_me_down/,17,"I have been using Samsung phones since I switched back when the iPhone 6S was announced and I was angry at the incremental upgrade. since then I have purchased 8 Samsung phones. I have been an advocate and even told people how much better they are than iPhone. Last year I convinced my wife (a long time iPhone user) to try the new Galaxy Note 9 and she had fallen in love with this phone...until. 6 months in the phone had started to have charging issues. we tried flashing it, factory resetting it, cleaning the charge port, switching chargers, buying original Samsung adapters and so on. the phone will only slow charge on anything except a PureGear charger. to top things off her S Pen cracked (which is apparently an issue). We finally just sent the phone in to be looked at and they called and said that the device was not under warranty because it's water damaged...the phone is water resistant!? she hasn't taken it into water, she does wipe her phone down a lot because she has OCD but that is ridiculous to think that cleaning it has caused enough water damage to prevent fast charge from working. So when it came back I took things into my own hands. I have replaced the battery with a high quality Ampsentrix battery, replaced the charge port with an oem charge port and flashed the phone again with a unbranded firmware hoping it was carrier specific and it STILL won't fast charge. today she called because we finally got our receipt for the phone and it was out of warranty so now she can't even get her pen replaced. So last year I bought a phone for $1100 that took water damage from being wiped down, voided warranty on a water damaged phone, got told repair would be $400 and S pen replacement was another $32 so if I want to continue using the phone I'll need to put another $432 into the phone... I can get an iPhone 11 Pro max with a 2 year apple extended warranty that will replace the whole phone for an extra $100 so the phone and warranty would be $1300 and replacement under the warranty would be $100 so $1400 and the phone would be functioning... might be time to switch back to iPhone...",1570914973.0,0
ATT service is shite with Galaxy unlocked devices,1,dguo2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/dguo2r/att_service_is_shite_with_galaxy_unlocked_devices/,9,"I've been using an unlocked note 9 for a year and have been strong with incoming calls not coming through. The danger would just say it gets disconnected after 1-2 rings. When making outbound calls, I have to move to somewhere where there's good service to allow the phone to stay to ring. Like it's 1995.

At first I thought it was the Samsung phone, went through lots of tech support with Samsung. They eventually replaced almost everything in my phone : the pcb, screen, fingerprint reader, camera, etc. Still not working. I then did a factory reset and switched to my wife's S9. Same problem (with a factory reset)

Prior to all this I contacted ATT and they sent me a new sim card and ""refreshed"" my network. This never helped.

I came att one more time (last ditch effort) and the rep kept blaming my unlocked phone.

A couple of weeks ago, I started getting this message whenever I'd plug in the charger. At first, I didn't think much of it because it was still charging, but I soon realised that it wasn't fast charging anymore. In fact, the charge has become slower than regular charge. It'll take around 3-4 hours if I leave it alone without using it. Sometimes, without any apparent criteria behind it, it'll fast charge, but most of the time it won't. i've really handled this phone carefully so i don't think something inside broke.

Now, I tried the following ""fixes"" that I found looking it up on the internet (none of which worked):

* Charging it by connecting it to my laptop
* Tried somebody else's charger
* Bought a new charger myself
* Cleaned and removed all the lint from the charger's port
* Tried multiple different sockets
* Tried charging it in safe mode
* Soft reset
* Factory reset

I've really run out of ideas, does anybody know what the hell is going on with my phone? why is it doing this after just a couple of months?",1570908822.0,0

I made an app to create countdown for important events with your friends/family,0,dgsm0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/dgsm0n/i_made_an_app_to_create_countdown_for_important/,12,"Hi Reddit, I would like to present the app I am currently developing with one of my colleague here at AppRover: a countdown app called… Countdown: Event Reminders.

[Download Countdown for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/countdown-event-reminders/id1470917789)

**What kind of app Countdown is?**

The need we try to fulfill is simple: have a fun and simple way to set countdown for special events with your friends or your family. Countdown is then an app allowing you to create personalized countdowns and to share them easily.

**What makes this app different from other countdown apps?**

* It offers a seamless experience: creating a countdown takes a few seconds. This is very important, and many competitors are offering a poor user experience right now.
* It has a beautiful catalog displaying all your active countdowns.
* It allows you to put a custom background from a template list, the library or by taking a photo
* It allows you to easily share your countdowns with a simple URL.

**What’s next?** 

The application is still in early development. We have plenty of improvement ideas:

* Countdowns shared inside the app: we’d like users to be able to open their friends countdowns within the app, not just with a web URL.
* Event reminders before the actual event date: this would be especially useful when you have to prepare something in advance.
* More customization for more fun: typo, stickers to add, more templates.
* Dark/Light Mode

**How much does it cost?** 

We’ve been advised to integrate a subscription business model. For now, there is a limit of 4 countdowns in the catalog. The monthly or annually subscription allows you to have unlimited backgrounds. Other Premium features will be added at each release.

**How can you help us?** 

We’d like to give away 10 promo codes for the launch. We’ll select randomly one of the commenter of this thread. We’re very interested in how you would personally use a countdown app. This would greatly help us to guide our next releases. I’ll be here if you have any question or feedback. Thank you very much for your time .

**TL;DR:** New Countdown App Free to download focusing on customization and sharing. Comment to get a chance to have a promo code.",1570899293.0,1

I got the international version so it's the highest spec in the model, 6GB RAM with 128GB storage. 

However, a deal has recently come up with a network provider. Optus, in Australia is providing a 24month contract on a Galaxy s10e with bonus Galaxy Buds and 30GB of Data per month for $58 AUD or $39 USD per month. 

The galaxy buds are not part of the repayment but supplied as a promo. There is no cancellation fee and I have the option to upgrade to a newer flagship phone in 12 months e.g S11 or whatever.

Wondering if it's worth the upgrade? I'm pretty pleased with the A50 and does whatever I need, but am not too impressed by the camera performance. I used to have a Pixel 2 XL so I was very much used to great photos, but rest in pieces that phone. 

Also how is the S10e with battery life? My A50 is excellent with 4000mah.

I'm paying $38 AUD or $26 per month no lock-in contract currently. 

Any recommendations and/or alternatives would be appreciated.

In combination with their [recent removal of the Quartz and HKMap apps from their store](https://mspoweruser.com/boycottapple-trending-as-apple-removes-quartz-news-and-hkmap-apps-from-app-store/), I think it is not only an interesting conversation to be had about Apple's hypocrisy, but an important one.

At the end of the day, Apple is a corporation in a capitalist society. Despite all of their public stances on social issues like LGBTQ rights, privacy, immigration, etc., I find that they only ever make strong social/political statements when it won't hurt their bottom line. Moreover, one could argue that they are simply building an image for their brand -- one that they use to attract and endear users to their ecosystem -- and that they do not necessarily believe as strongly in these ideals as they should or [have stated that they do](https://www.cultofmac.com/557719/tim-cook-apple-social-issues-speak-out/).

It does not take [courage to remove a headphone jack from a smartphone](https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12838024/apple-iphone-7-plus-headphone-jack-removal-courage). It takes courage to stand up for what you espouse to believe in no matter the ramifications. Apple wants to use historical figures like Einstein, Ali, Gandhi, and MLK Jr. in their [Think Different campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFEarBzelBs)? These men (and their female contemporaries) spoke and acted out against the injustices they saw in the world. Perhaps Apple could learn to do the same.

"After hearing the rumors about a high refresh rate display on the Galaxy S11, I'm not sure if I still want to pick up an S10+ at a Black Friday discount",1,dgi45b,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/dgi45b/after_hearing_the_rumors_about_a_high_refresh/,5,"I've been looking into getting an S10+ these past few months, and after digging on ebay and realizing that Best Buy had it on a steep discount ($600 new) during Prime Day, i decided I'll just wait until Black Friday to pick one up for hopefully even $500 before tax if it gets discounted that much. I didn't really care for the rumored S11 at the time because of no headphone jack (which i literally use every day, and assumed wouldn't exist anyway after the Note 10 and the upper-range A series phones) and the camera upgrades don't interest me that much.

After hearing about the strong possibility of a 90Hz display, however, or even a 120Hz, I decided to take a second to consider the next one. While I've never actually used or seen a high refresh rate phone before, i do use a 144hz monitor on my main computer, and hearing people like Marques and Linus speak so highly of the display rate of the OnePlus 7P or iPad Pro made me very interested. So now I'm confused on whether to try for a very cheap S10+ soon or wait until next Prime Day for a decent discount on the S11.

For reference, i plan on keeping the phone for the next 3 or so years, so the decision is pretty significant. I also don't want to spend $1000 on a phone, so buying the 10+ next month and then trading it in for an S11 if i end up liking that is not really reasonable to me. Any advice?

I'm loving Bixby routines!,5,dghsf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/dghsf2/im_loving_bixby_routines/,10,"I haven't had a Samsung phone since the Captivate and am loving my Note 10+. I haven't been this excited with a phone purchase in a long time.  
I found out about Bixby routines, and sadly am now hearing about other apps that can do a lot of things that routines can do.  
But this is what I have and am going to use.  
Anyways, here are some of my routines that I have set up and would like to see what you guys are using.

At home (location based): wifi on, AOD on, bluetooth off (don't use it at home), ringer on  
In car (bluetooth device connected): Disable lock screen, play music with google play, AOD off, wifi off  
At work (location based): wifi off, AOD off, bluetooth off, set to vibrate

Some creative ones that I found

Atmos (selected by app): certain apps turn on atmos (music, youtube, gallery)  
Auto-rotate (selected by app): I have auto rotate off, when certain apps are enabled, they enable it. (youtube, gallery, games)  
Blue light filter (location AND time based) if at home after X:XX and before X:XX, then turn on Blue light filter
Volume down (selected by app): Games set media volume to 25%

This are most of my Bixby routines that I have set up. I'm sure there's a way to optimize what I have set up, but it's doing mostly what I ask it to.

My only ""fixes"" or changes that I'd like to make are being able to set the ringer to a specific volume (so work can have the ringer at 10% at work and 50% at home).  
And I'd like to be able to set a ""default state"". So if none of the conditions (routines) are active, then the phone goes into the default state (ringer at 100%, no wifi, aod off, and so on)",1570840981.0,0

Or when a person is holding the phone while asking Siri questions. In this situation, Siri should lower the voice as if it’s talking to the person like a human, making use of the Face ID sensors, ambient noise and strong invoke command volume.

Meta: Political post request...,0,dg9id0,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/dg9id0/meta_political_post_request/,26,"Not sure how to go about this, but I have a request...

(And this is with all due respect to everyone in this subreddit.)

I go to the Apple sub to read about Apple product/service information and to see what the community thinks about everything. I’ve learned a lot and this is my first stop when I want to know what’s happening in the world of Apple. 

However, recently this sub has become more politicized. I’ve noticed more and more posts about China/Hong Kong, etc and it seems to be taking up a lot of space. 

I live in Hong Kong. And while I appreciate the attention our city is getting, I don’t think many people around the world fully understand the nuances of the current protest. Many redditors make quick comments about things they may not know much about because they have a strong opinion about certain countries. 

The netizen outrage machine is tearing across so many subs right now and I’m getting a little exhausted from seeing so many posts when I can tell that many of them are misguided - even if they have the best of intentions. 

I may be alone here, but honestly, I just want to see reviews, rumors, innovations, history, etc. on this sub rather than the political fare. Please understand me, I KNOW it’s newsworthy, and I KNOW that it pertains to Apple. And I know the posts are following the rules of the sub because the mods have allowed them to be posted. 

However, again, it’s just...exhausting. Pretty much the only thing on Hong Kongers minds are protests. It’s taken over our lives. I just want to get on Reddit to ESCAPE the protest and the Apple sub is one of my favorite places to go to escape. 

Again, this is with all due respect to the mods and redditors in this sub. I don’t think anyone has done anything with malicious intent. I’m just...worn out by the politics of the current state of affairs and I want to talk about iPhones, Mac Pros and future tech like AR Headsets. 

Thanks.

Edit: I’m going to hide posts and probably add filters on Reddit. I posted this originally because I’ve just been overwhelmed by Hong Kong news. It’s been going on for 4 months, but has recently exploded on Reddit. Seeing it deep into the Apple subreddit just felt too much.

This is on me. I need to be more vigilant and not ask a whole community to change. The reason Reddit works is because people can vote and obviously this is a topic people care about and want to talk about.

I’ll take the responsibility and adjust my own usage. Thanks for the feedback, honestly.",1570794231.0,1

One ui 2.0 beta.,3,dg4gu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/dg4gu9/one_ui_20_beta/,1,"Exclusive: One UI 2.0 features will include Emoji suggestions

￼

Samsung will make major software-related announcements at its developers’ conference next month. That’s when we’ll get a good look at One UI 2.0, the next major iteration of its custom skin. The company will likely also detail its plans for Android 10 at the event.
As you can probably expect, there will be quite a few new features included in One UI 2.0. We hear that one of those features will be Emoji suggestions and predictions. It will be a fun little addition to the Samsung Keyboard. It will surface these suggestions as you’re typing along.

Emoji suggestions will be part of One UI 2.0

This won’t really be a groundbreaking feature. There are countless messaging apps that will show Emoji suggestions and predictions as you type. KakoTalk, a Korean messaging app that’s quite popular across Asia, is one such example. Line is another.
Similar functionality has long been offered by third-party keyboards as well. Offering this feature with the native keyboard will ensure that users have fewer reasons to switch away from Samsung Keyboard.
We recently got our first look at Android 10 and One UI 2.0 on a Galaxy S10. The video showed a glimpse of the new gesture system that Android 10 brings to the table. Google has made it mandatory for OEMs to bring these stock navigation gestures to their devices.
The One UI design itself doesn’t appear to have changed much but since this was likely a very early development build, chances are that things may have changed along the way.",1570770004.0,0

Now there is when the broadcast is in HDR.

So I'm wondering if it's now automatic that the TV switches to HDR and no longer necessary to check the HDR+ setting to on in the menu? Like I said, when I do this, the picture quality looks like shit, brownish and washed out.

It was showing unlocked at the store just fine and normal. My sister has been unable to use it despite lengthy troubleshooting with sprint. They finally told her that it doesn’t look like the unlock process had fully taken, so I chatted Verizon support. They were going to do the manual unlock for me and asked when I had it replaced. It was 10 days ago. He then immediately said, oh yeah, that’s the issue. All new smartphones are locked for 60 days to combat fraud. They can not unlock it and there are no exceptions. I’ve had the phone for a year and it’s not a “new” phone but to Verizon it is.

I paid for an unlocked device, and after a warranty replacement, it’s now “re-locked” to Verizon for 2 months. This is a new policy as of this year. In Apple’s systems it is showing full unlocked. It’s my phone, I paid for it. 

This needs to get big because this is one of the shittiest policies I’ve seen with a telecom company. Probably switching carriers due to this.

Edit : the swap was from an Apple retail store. Showed unlocked. Proper activation profile transfer. Verizon is actively blocking other carrier activations. 

I was able to get it resolved but had to go through channels most people don’t have access to. Be warned if you plan on swapping a phone to sell it. It won’t be unlocked for 2 months.",1570764336.0,1

"Beware, Samsung's website is full of flaws!!!",9,dfzgd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/dfzgd2/beware_samsungs_website_is_full_of_flaws/,4,"So yesterday I woke up around 5-6 AM to get ready for work and noticed I had some emails regarding a new Galaxy S10e order... I did not think much of it, my family phone provider account is all linked to me and my dad tends to switch phones quite often...

&#x200B;

A couple minutes later it clicked that the email I received was not from my phone provider, but from Samsung itself. Now I have not had a Samsung phone since June/July last year due to several issues I had with the Note 8. So I went and logged into my Samsung account and found out there were two attempts to place an order for this phone. Both of them were declined by my bank fortunately. I assumed someone had gotten my card information somehow so I called the bank asked them to send me a replacement and deactivate what I had, I also went and change my bank/email passwords; just in case…

Problem solved… I wish…

&#x200B;

This morning I woke up to a third attempt to purchase the same phone, now I am sure whoever is doing this has my Samsung account information. So I proceed to try and delete any payment information I have saved on their site, well it seems that is not an option. Logging into your Samsung account only lets you change your Name, Address and Email. Well… that’s retarded, guess I will have to call them, in the meantime I think I can at least change my password to avoid whoever keeps logging into my account to do it again. Simple enough process, enter old password, enter new password, confirm… DONE!!

&#x200B;

Well I keep trying to find a way to delete my debit card information from the website, and while this happens I got logged out, I try logging in again but forgot I just changed the password and enter the old one… IT WORKS!! WTF!!! I must be crazy right? I just changed the password for a totally different one, well guess what folks? Both passwords work, so now whoever has my account info can still log in as usual.

&#x200B;

At this point I have called Samsung costumer service 4 times already with no resolution, I recreated the steps to purchase a new phone online as well and I noticed that Samsung saved my debit card information and does not require it to be updated if the card expires nor will it ask for a security code before attempting to do a new purchase.

&#x200B;

So just a quick summary of all the flaws I have found on Samsung’s website so far:

\-	There is no way to delete or even access saved payment information through their website, unless you actually try buying a new phone. And even then, it will not let you delete it.

\-	They do not require expiration information or security code from your card, it seems the last legit purchase I did from their site was in June 2018… I have probably had my card replaced 2-3 times already since then.

\-	Changing the password on the account does not work!! I currently have two passwords that will allow me to log into my account.

At this point I am running out of ideas on how to proceed, does anyone know if I have grounds to file an FTC complaint in the meantime? Samsung really needs to fix up these issues asap. Anyway, going to call Samsung again right now, will update when I get this resolved…

EDIT: Just got off the phone with Samsung, apparently they do not have the “feature” to remove your bank/debit card information off your account. So they recommended me to fully close my samsung account, I guess I will do this and hope they don’t fuck this up as well...",1570749268.0,0

I use a fast charger while I’m in the shower and cooking breakfast and once it’s done I’ll be on my phone constantly until the next day. The only time I have to extra charge is when using maps and that’s only because my phone is docked on the windshield and it’s 500 degrees outside. 

But in all I’m just shocked by how well Apple optimizes this phone and its battery and I’m super excited to see what comes out in 2020.",1570747014.0,1

Using Sidecar on the iPad makes me wish for an iPad with native macOS.,31,dfsc5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/dfsc5i/using_sidecar_on_the_ipad_makes_me_wish_for_an/,18,"I upgraded my work MacBook to Catalina today and first thing to test out was Sidecar. And I'm very impressed. Even wireless Sidecar worked flawlessly for me. The image quality was indistinguishable for me from a native interface, I didn't notice any artifacts whatsoever. The latency is great too, testing mouse movement there was very little input lag.

But of course, this entire experience is still powered by a very beefy MacBook Pro. With all the rumors about Apple working on ARM Macs, I'm really hoping we might see macOS on the iPad at some point.

Hear me out: I get that iPadOS has made advances, but frankly, it's still so far from being usable as a viable alternative for my work.

How my ideal iPad would look like: Honestly, ideally Apple would take the Dex idea from Samsung and actually execute it properly. 
So, while the iPad is portable, it runs iPadOS just as it does right now. However, if I dock it at home or at work, I'd like it to switch to macOS. Specifically, I'd like the iPad to get full mouse and keyboard support. I also need a proper external screen support, not the mirroring stuff you can do right now with the proper dongle. It really needs to be as solid as macOS' display settings with various options for resolutions, aspect ratios and scaling.

Those are the big ones for me.

We're doing already quite well on the keyboard support side (though I'm not sure I could plug a USB keyboard into an iPad and have that working), the mouse support as we all know is very rudimentary and external screen support is even more basic. Once these are solved I think I could work on the iPad.

The huge benefit of macOS would obviously be the library of software that's available for it. Yes, Adobe promised a full-featured Photoshop for iPad, but it's nowhere to be seen. I can however drag that Photoshop window to the iPad with Sidecar and use the Apple Pencil in Photoshop just fine. Same goes for all the other software that either has no equivalent on the iPad or an inferior one (and I get why, you have to design interfaces differently when you're aiming for touch controls versus the granularity of a mouse or pencil and the willingness to pay for software is different). Also, running Parallels on an iPad would be pretty great for the odd Windows program.

Finally, we all know the hardware of the current iPads is extremely powerful and could most likely easily run macOS if power wouldn't be a concern (hence docked-mode). It would also change the value-proposition of those iPads that nowadays cost as much as entry-level MacBooks significantly, if they gained this hybrid functionality.

What do you think? Will we see something like this in the coming years? Why not? What are the biggest hurdles to get there?",1570707672.0,1

Some weird bug I dont know how to fix,1,dfmd1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/dfmd1f/some_weird_bug_i_dont_know_how_to_fix/,3,"Hi guys. Today my phone suddenly started to disconnect and connect to the wifi at home. It says internet connection is not available, but 2 laptops, another galaxy s9 is connected and all of these devices run smoothly, they have connection, but somehow my phone does this. To the university wifi it could connect without a problem. I restarted the modem, made a factory reset on the modem, changed the SSID and password, reset the internet options on the phone, forgot the wifi, restarted the phone. When I factory reset the wifi it could connect but then the laptops couldnt connect, then I restarted the modem and then everything back to normal, everything connects appart from my phone. I dont know what to do at this point. By the way the internet got slow on every device. It used to be 200+ Mbps not \~50. And sometimes it dropped to 1-3 Mbps from time to time. I think it can be the modem, but then all devices work appart mine. But on any other wifi like a hotspot of the laptop or the other phone it works. Can someone help me?",1570679493.0,0

You'd thing Samsung would not send the incorrect item three times, right? At least they could lie to me and tell me the color I want is out of stock, but no...

Towards the beginning of August 2019, my right Galaxy Bud broke under warranty. This pair was one I purchased from an online retailer and I was able to exchange it to Samsung for free, under warranty for free. Keep in mind this pair was white.

Unfortunately, when the new pair arrived two weeks later, it was in the Yellow color. This matters to me as I'd expect the same product to be returned. I was never made aware of why this color change occurred and the Galaxy Buds were still in stock in white online. This didn't make sense to me, so I called customer service back about this. They said it was simply a mistake, so I sent back the yellow pair for a white pair.

Unfortunately, two weeks later, I recieved yet another yellow pair. This absolutely made no sense. I called back again the day those arrived and told Customer Service the issue. They said they would escalate this situation. A few days later, I was called by someone higher up in the customer service department who apologized profusely about this and agreed to send me a white pair. They said it would definitely be white this time and said it would arrive in a few business days.

This brings us to today, nearly THREE WEEKS later (so much for their ""fastest shipping""), where the earbuds arrive again. Yellow. A third time. After the customer service lady said for the third time they would be WHITE.

This all seems kinda crazy to me, so if anyone here has insight into what to do, let me know! I'm done trying to contact the customer service and promotion lines as they are obviously hot garbage with this issue. I sent this information to the office of the CEO today, so fingers crossed they can help.",1570611028.0,0

I've taken it to samsung in romford twice now, they've replaced the battery and motherboard but 3rd time in a year its happened again. I'm still in warranty. 

It's getting a bit ridiculous, what can I do? Can I demand the phone to be replaced?

S8+ randomly reboots,2,dezztb,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/dezztb/s8_randomly_reboots/,3," Have also posted in r/galaxys8, though I'm not sure if anyone there knows/if this is common to other devices.

Hi all. I use an S8+ (SM-G955FD) now running Android 9 that was purchased in March 2018. It's been fine until around September 2019, when it suddenly began rebooting out of nowhere. I may be using it halfway, or just having it on the table next to me, when suddenly it will go black and boot from the Samsung Galaxy S8+ logo. It gets really frustrating because I have no idea when it'll happen. So far, I have not been able to discern any pattern in the reboots, including:

* timing (can happen any time of day)
* apps open at the time
* number of apps open at the time
* temperature
* whether or not I'm using a phone case
* whether or not it's in a pocket
* whether or not I manually clear RAM
* whether or not I'm in power saving mode
* whether before or after the OTA software update that was pushed out in September (it started shortly before)

I have wiped the cache partition, and booted to safe mode, but found nothing that could be the problem. Is there anything I haven't tried? Am skeptical about doing a factory reset because I worry it might not help. One thing I do notice is that it tends to happen in clusters (few reboots within about 10 minutes). It went into a bootloop and high temperature once, which I thankfully somehow managed to stop by turning it off and letting it cool down. Most of the time, however, it's a couple of boots - the phone boots, is usable for a short time before it random-reboots again. Sometimes, the subsequent boots go straight to the Samsung logo (not the S8+ powered by Samsung one).

Anyone else has faced the same problem, and/or fixed it?",1570570262.0,0

it's an year and so i've been using my tab s4 to take handwritten notes (engineering) during lessons but i'm struggling with Samsung Notes because:

1. PDF conversion is crap cause resolution is too damn low, also pages are cropped making some parts unreadable
2. No page organization (don't get why they removed this useful function that old S Notes had) so i get ridiculously long JPEGs.
3. Can't open .SDOC files outside samsung devices

It's clear it turns to be nearly impossible to share my notes with my other non-samsung devices without clunky tricks.

So i tried the old S-Note app but writing it's pretty, well, uncomfortable...

Do you have an alternative that will work fine with the s-Pen? Somebody suggested to me Bamboo Paper or Squid for example, it's important for me to make them into PDFs not screwed up.

Is this a huge deal?

After trying out the phones in person, I am torn between these three:

Note 9:

* I love the size and boxy shape of this thing. Photos are also really nice too, love the battery life, pixel density, and SD card slot
* Not sure if SD 845 is enough for Wii/GC Games, but that's my only gripe

S10+:

* Holy moly this thing takes wonderful photos. Love the pixel density as well, SD card slot is nice too. I'd prefer if the shape was more like the Note 9 but that's alright. Not a fan of the punch hole but it's not going to kill me.
* SD 855 is great for emulation, so that's nice

Note 10:

* Tried out the 10 in person, similar size to the Note 9. I prefer the photos on this model but the fingerprint sensor is superior on the Note 9. Pixel density is nice but not as good as the Note 9. No SD card slot as well so I'm not sure. Not a fan of the punch hole.
* SD 855 is great for emulation, so that's nice

Note 10+:

* Love the specs on this one, but I'm not sure about the size since I haven't tried it out yet. SD Card slot is nice. Not a fan of the punch hole. Also it's really expensive.
* SD 855 is great for emulation, so that's nice.

Can't input 2FA code for app started from secure folder,1,deu6v6,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/deu6v6/cant_input_2fa_code_for_app_started_from_secure/,4,"Hi,

I have a banking app installed in the secure folder which requires 2FA to log in, but after switching away from it to get 2FA code and switching back, the banking app starts from scratch so it's impossible to input 2FA code.

Here are the steps I take and the problem I have:

1. Open secure folder
2. Open banking app from the secure folder
3. Click log in
4. Input user/password
5. App asks to provide 2FA code (from another app)
6. I switch to the 2FA app and memorize the code
7. I switch back to the banking app, but this time it prompts me to provide PIN to enter secure folder (since that's where this app is)
8. After providing correct PIN it starts the banking app but instea of showing screen to input 2FA code, it just starts from scratch.

&#x200B;

It seems like switching away from app which is being run in the secure folder makes it forget the app's state.

Any way to fix that? I'd expect that most of apps which people would wanna put in the secure folder also have 2FA (since ""by definition"" these are apps/accounts we care the most about and want to secure them as much as possible... if I can't use it with 2FA then secure folder seems kind of useless.",1570532442.0,0

I recently saw that my 2016 UN65KS8000 Samsung TV has a single horizontal line on the top third of the screen. I've changed inputs and it appears the line is still there despite what device / app I am using. Is this an indicator that the actual LCD has an issue?

Restore Photos To Phone?,1,depaav,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/depaav/restore_photos_to_phone/,0,"Yesterday I upgraded to the Note 10+(I love it so far, fantastic phone) and although I was able to restore settings, home screen, etc from my previous phone, I chose not to do pictures at the time (store had slow Wi-Fi, etc).

 I have about 8GB worth of photos, going back a few years. On my previous phone, I had used Google Photos as a back up, and everything was synced to Google photos from that phone. I planned on just re-saving all the photos to my Note 10 from Google Photos, because I could have sworn I've done it before at some point in time . But, unless I'm missing something, it doesn't seem like there's an easy or efficient way of saving all photos back to my device, I don't want to have to be connected to the internet in order to view my photos. 

Samsung apparently also made a back up of my gallery, and when I go into my empty gallery, and hit sync now, it begins going through and syncing all the photos so now they show up in my gallery. However, this not only takes quite a long time, but I don't think they're actually being placed on the phone its self. I say this because when I pull up say Messages or Discord, none of the synced photos are available to send, only photos I've taken or downloaded in the little amount of time I've had the new phone.

So, my question is, what is the easiest or most efficient way to restore all my photos to my device, so that they are on the device its self also? I should also add I don't have access to my old device.  Thanks for any help.",1570509122.0,0

..aside from the obvious, i.e. post-processing and camera crews, of course.  The default camera/video app is rubbish, unless there's something I'm missing with it.  For example, there's not even an option to shoot in 24 FPS to even achieve that ""cinematic"" look and feel.  From what I saw with the behind the scenes of the short film's production there weren't any lenses attached to the phone for the purpose of demonstrating the power of the phone itself.  I'm even betting on there being very minimum post-processing for that reason alone. 

That being said there had to be an advanced (and I'm sure not-free) camera/video app Samsung was using to achieve this.  I'm looking to make a short (and inexpensive) film using the phone as a proof-of-concept for a bigger project I'm pitching to a professional.

3. Often an app will require you to use in portrait mode even when the app/tab is being used in landscape.

Hi there!

My name is Noah and I made Mac Mouse Fix. When I started this project I was completely new to software development but with the power of Google, Stack Overflow, and Apple's Developer Documentation at my fingertips I managed to learn what is necessary to deliver a solid little app that I hope will be useful for many people! Working on Mac Mouse Fix made me discover a passion for programming, and led me to enroll in a Computer Science Degree at college, which has been awesome so far. I've been quite busy with that last semester, but this summer break I finally found the time to work on Mouse Fix again and I'm so glad to finally share it with you!

# Features

* Switch Between Spaces, activate Mission Control, Launchpad, or Quick Look, or use the side buttons to navigate through pages in your browser. All of that and more. Right from your mouse.
* New Smooth Scrolling algorithm that strikes a perfect balance between fluidity and control. Allows you to change mouse scrolling direction independently of trackpad scrolling direction.
* 100% free, light on system resources, and fully open source. Plugs into System Preferences. There is no status bar item. Mouse Fix aims to be as clutter-free as possible.

Help make Mac Mouse Fix even better on [GitHub](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix).

# Questions

Why make it? There are already apps for smooth scrolling and remapping mouse buttons.

I was looking for a way to use Spaces and Mission Control from my mouse. I found some great software like Steer Mouse and BetterTouchTool, but none of it was free. So I decided to build my own - 100% free - solution. I worked on the smooth scrolling algorithm mostly because it was a lot of fun and I also think it fits Mac Mouse Fix really well.

* If I open chrome will it reopen all the tabs I have on my phone? (what about samsung browser)

my question for discussion is this. this is exclusively a samsung feature currently, it's not something android manufacturers as a whole have adopted.

does anyone think that Apple has any interest in doing this? they have undeniably the best processors in the mobile space. Samsung does this with 4/6/8gb Ram in their phones, so Ram is also there. lightning to usb cable, your standard charger could do something like this.

saw one app that can do lots of customizations called Good lock, not available on the galaxy store in my country, a friend helped me with APK, but also that didn't work and needs VPN

can someone explain to me why an app made by samsung for free, available only on the galaxy store, not available world wide ? it doesn't make any sense....",1570311702.0,0

Anyone having issues with PowerShare on the Note10+ when charging a Galaxy Watch?,1,ddmnti,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/ddmnti/anyone_having_issues_with_powershare_on_the/,4,"One of the features I was looking forward to for the Note10+ was the PowerShare feature so I can charge my watch without having to worry about bringing the separate charger (unrelated rant; why the heck did Samsung use a micro-USB for the Galaxy Wear charger?).

Unfortunately I'm having a ton of issues with this. 
I first remove the case I have. Wireless charging DOES work with the case I have, but I still remove it anyway to give it a better chance.

I turn on PowerShare, place my watch on the back of the phone, and it makes the ""doo doot"" sound to acknowledge it's charging. It'll then complain about placement. 

I reposition the watch, it makes the  the ""doo doot"" sound again and then it complains again about the position. I finally get it positioned correctly and it charges for about 15 seconds before it then complains about the position...even though it never moved. Rinse/repeat.

Anyone else having this issue? I wish there was like a tiny positioning magnet or even a circle where the magic spot is on the Note10+",1570307529.0,0

Note 9 appreciation post,43,ddlq4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/ddlq4o/note_9_appreciation_post/,26,"I've had my note 9 for little over a year now and I wanted to shine some light on the best phone I've owned. 

The big reason for buying the N9 was the features. It seems to be the last Swiss army knife phone that can do everything, and do so very well. Granted, the battery life recently has taken a slight turn downward. But, thanks to jerryrigeverything I'll take a crack at replacing the battery when it becomes too much of a drag (obviously practicing on older phones I no longer use). 

I seem to be the only person I know who can't handle having a notch or a teardrop on the screen, so having a completely symmetrical screen is a must. Speaking of the screen, it's glorious. Yes there are better and quicker displays out there now, but it's still a gorgeous display and I see no need to upgrade in the near future. 

The pen is very much a gimmick, but it's one I use quite alot to doodle and take the occasional note. Now I don't think I'd buy a phone without it because, ye know, features. 

The cameras, specifically on the back, are excellent. Last year I went to Iceland (check my previous posts if you like) and took some amazing on the fly photos that could compete with with a high quality SLR. Aaaaaaand it took me around 2.5 seconds to take the shot. 

Expendable memory. I have an SD card with various films and series's on and it's great when going on holiday or even commuting to know I can always have something to watch without munching data. 

Fast charging. Getting 60-80% charge from next to nothing after 30 mins or so is brilliant. That boost before heading out and knowing if need be, I can use ultra power saving mode to always last me the next day or even more if needed. 

All in all, it's been the first phone in a looooooong time that's made me feel I don't need to upgrade every couple of years. Hopefully the phone lasts some more years. 

Anyways, thanks for reading.

Upgrade Opinion (I guess?),1,ddlaxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/ddlaxu/upgrade_opinion_i_guess/,9,"Im currently using a Galaxy S5 (SM-G901F) andI think its time to upgrade. I came to the conclusion to maybe upgrade to a Galaxy S10+ even tho I dont need that big of a Screen and I dont need and want that bigger punchhole compared to the normal S10. I think I never used the froncamere to begin with. But I want the bigger batterie. So, Im planning on upgrading next year in the spring after the new phones will be released to look if there is a better deal (like 90hz Display. Would go with One Plus 7 Pro: I dont use cameras that often and the frontfacing one I never really use, but 7 Pro has no Headphone Jack and no expandable storage. Ok I got Galaxy Buds so no headphonejack shouldnt be that worse but at night, in my bed, I still use wired headphones to watch video and to have an extra feature like a headphonejack is convenient.) thats why Im currently considering the S10+ even with that bigger punchhole etc. But as I said, Im waiting till spring next year to see if a better deal and better phones will come out and if nothing special will come out from any brand, than the S10+ will be a lot cheaper because of the new generation and the price is a major point to consider for me because Im only 18 and still in school. Im pretty sure I will execute my plans but I would like to know what you guys have to say about that. Thanks!

EDIT: Should have state it earlier: Im open for every Android phone exept Huawei (cause of the android prob. and the skin, which i dont like) But I want an indisplay fingerprint sensor and a big battery, so thats why Im considering the S10+ in Samsungs lineup",1570298563.0,0

To upgrade or not to upgrade? That is the question.,5,ddl3dw,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/ddl3dw/to_upgrade_or_not_to_upgrade_that_is_the_question/,4,"Sitting in bed, listening to music and high as a pufferfish, I'm debating a new purchase.
I'm currently on the Note 8 and have no issues with it. A couple of days before the warranty expires. I have changed the charging port and the battery and at some point I had some burn-ins. Sammy reps were nice enough to change the screen and the back panel and the battery again, so it looks brand new with no scratches whatsoever.
BUT
My gf got herself an S10+ and thinks I should get the Note 10+ as well.
I went to a Sammy store to play with the Note 10+ and it's awesome. 
I like the design change, the cameras, the S-pen new capabilities and hell, I'd get it.
BUT
I'm afraid that Sammy will finally bring a higher screen refresh rate on the S11, meaning that would happen on the Note 11.
I love the Note 10+ features, I really do. But they seem like an upgrade while a 90hz screen would be something new, and I think I'm inclined to want something new rather then an upgrade. 

Do you think Samsung will finally bring the 90hz panels in 2020? Do you think is better to wait another year, while also risking for that not to happen or should I just swallow it and get a Note 10+? 
Obviously this is debate is created in mind because I have regular (medium) income. If I would have been in the higher middle class, I think  I'd get a phone whenever I felt like getting it.

I run the Note 4 myself and yes i  know its old but i dont see anything in the Note lineup now that really makes me want to go ""I NEED TO BUY THIS NOW!!"" Not everyone can purchase a new phone year after year. The Note 10 was going to be my next purchade because my Note 4 is getting quite old but turned out it was missing the headphone jack so i decided not to get a phone for yet another year. 

&nbsp;

That made me want to ask this question so i hope to hear your replies :))

&nbsp;
Features I'd like to see and why:

&nbsp;

- Headphone jack  a good dac (give your customers options! The Note lineup was supposed to be an all-rounded phone with everything you ever needed and not a phone you needed to compromise when you bought)
.
- 90Hz screen (i mean who doesnt)
.
- Flat screen (it doesn't really add anything to the display but make it harder to get a case that can protect the phone)
.
- Faster charging  (im not sure about this but from what i know, samsing is lagging behind in terms of charging speed now)
.
- IR Blaster (i nearly forgot to add one of the most important features. The convenience of having your phone as a remote is unparalleled. With more people having smart homes this feature will be used much more than before)",1570276765.0,0

At first I was in love with this phone, and part of me still is. I loved the battery (but that's because i came from an iPhone SE), but now I've realized it's actually terrible. I'm 100% done, the battery has been garbage, and I've had endless problems like not being able to disable that stupid fucking warning message any time I felt like listening to my music on full blast. I'm sick of the random laggy stutters, I'm sick of not being able to receive videos from friends with an iphone over text messaging because the video turns into 144p, I'm sick of how the animations dont feel smooth no matter how much I try to make them feel smooth, from goodlock to window animations, etc. I'm sick of having to rotate the end of my charger until it decides to fast charge instead of slow charge, I'm tired of the lack of brightness outside even with auto brightness enabled, I'm sick of it all. I almost never had problems with my iphone. Sure its bland and boring as shit and theres a lack of android's unfathomable ability to be customized, but I think I'm just going to go back to silly smooth animations, no stuttering, imessage, facetime, etc. Android is fucking fantastic in it's own way, but I'm not willing to deal with the areas it performs poorly in. And honestly I used to constantly make fun of iPhone battery but the iphone 11 max has better battery than any relevant android out right now which impresses me immensely. I'm prepared for the downvotes because I've criticized android in an android subreddit which will yield downvotes and toxic replies but I'm willing to swim through the replies and see if ANYONE agrees with me. With that being said, I'm definelty dreading the bland boring experience that is IOS, as well as the lack of being able to do fucking anything with your phone besides install apps and change your wallpaper.",1570238461.0,0

Note8 BT Issues,2,dd5sb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/dd5sb0/note8_bt_issues/,0,"So I did a bit of a search and couldn't find that much discussion about this besides a few old posts. This seems to be a pretty large issue that I've found through Google and there's still no fix? So my partner has a Note 8. Hasn't been rooted or nothing, still as is from the shop. The Bluetooth to her car worked for around a few months when car was new. Car is a Kia Cerato 2018, nothing been changed to this either. Bluetooth works fine on all other phones connected, my s10+, MIL iPhone 8.
So I sort of gave up with this BT issue....until I went out and bought my partner a pair of galaxy buds a few weekends back. I said to her, great..this will solve the no talking in car issue we have.

How wrong I was....no calls working through the buds either. Tf? Music, audio books, is all fine. Calls....no go. Whats the point of spending all that money on a new phone at the time only to have quite a large BT issue arise, and still no fix? This is beyond a joke now that we have a pair of buds that are just a paper weight when it comes to a call?
Sorry for the rant but this isn't exactly encouraging for any newer phones from samsung that may have issues come up...what's their hope of a fix when this is still ongoing?

I currently have a Galaxy S10+, GWA2 and Apple Airpods (I know, I know, but they're so much more compatible with my ears than the EarBuds)

I connect that same controller to my android phone (non-samsung) and it's perfectly fine. I can control the home screen and play games.

Can someone help with this? There must be some setting I'm missing but cannot find anything online.",1570085006.0,0

Amazing Apple Store experience today...,102,dc5kik,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/dc5kik/amazing_apple_store_experience_today/,82,"The camera on my iPhone 6 Plus (that I have had since new for 5 years) started acting funky about two weeks ago. Basically all the pictures were coming out choppy or blurry. I saw that there was more/less a recall on this phone for this exact issue, however my phone was one year outside of eligibility. I had to go to the mall near me, the only one with an Apple Store. I decided just to pop in, no appointment made. I checked in, they said someone could look at it in one hour. I received a text 40 minutes later that my Genius was ready for me. They took a look at it, ran diagnostics, and determined it was in fact the camera. I was REALLY expecting this to be a $100-$200 repair, nope. It was $59. Shocked, I agreed for them to fix it. They said it would be done in about 90 minutes. I decided to grab dinner close by and came back...done on time as they said. Not only was I seriously impressed with the punctuality and service, but the price was amazing for a genuine Apple repair. The only other issue I've had with this phone was the battery, also replace at a serious discount by Apple. The mute/unmute button can also be tempermental.

Opinion: Adding inline video playback to iOS was a big mistake,0,dbzkx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/dbzkx5/opinion_adding_inline_video_playback_to_ios_was_a/,6,"I believe it was iOS 10 that added the feature and I've gotta say, I've always disliked it.

When I'm scrolling through a website or Twitter feed on a phone and I tap a video, it used to take over the display. It used to fill the screen - either small with massive black bars in portrait orientation, or filling the screen in landscape orientation.

I guess Apple thought that allowing videos to play inline (ie. with the rest of your content still visible) is a power feature that makes the phone more versatile, but in my opinion, that was a big step backwards.

Maybe that's good in portrait orientation, but one of the beautiful things about the iPhone - dating all the way back to when Steve first showed it off in January of 2007 - was how you could simply turn the screen, the video would fill it up, and you could now watch in full screen. It was so beautifully simple and convenient.

Now, even when you turn the screen, it still only takes up a minor window, and you have to do that outward pinch each time to manually fill it up. It may not sound like much, but in practice, I find that to be a big step backwards in terms of general simplicity and usability of the device.

This is one of those areas where there's a conflict between power features and design/simplicity. Sometimes simplicity has to be sacrificed to make a device more powerful (ie. iPadOS adds a lot of complexity to the UI and makes it less phone-like and more computer-like, but I think the tradeoff was worth it). But other times, I think simplicity should win out. Video playback on iPhone is an example of that.

What do you think? Do other iOS users agree or disagree?",1569991750.0,1

I can watch 6 Netflix episodes in a row and go from 37-2%, then plug the phone into my fast charger and brush my teeth and floss (maybe 8-10 minutes) and come back to 24% battery. 

This is not being talked about enough. Perhaps because it’s new to me, maybe fast chargers were available before, but I can easily go 18h-24h of use on my phone, charge it for a negligible amount of time and then have it good to go for the rest of the evening.

I think in terms of college students. You use your phone all day, finally you get home and you’re about to go out. Before you shower and look nice for the night, plug it in and you’ll have enough battery to last you the evening and literally the whole next day.

Samsung Galaxy S7 Music Player not displaying proper album art.,1,dc03dx,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/dc03dx/samsung_galaxy_s7_music_player_not_displaying/,1,"I downloaded a [fan-made anthology](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/clp3ll/super_smash_bros_anthology_complete_enhanced/) of video game music, with 35 ""volumes"" that each serve as independent albums, and are tagged as such. However, each volume features many different songs with different album art. When I connected my Samsung S7 to my PC (Windows 8.1) and copy+pasted all of the music to my phone, the albums do not display the correct cover art in the stock music player. The cover of the album itself appears to display a random cover of one of the songs in the album, and every song displays that same cover instead of what it SHOULD be displaying.

Example: Songs 1, 2, and 3 are all in ""Volume 5"" but they all have different cover art. I copy all 3 songs to my phone and I open the default Samsung Music Player. The cover of Song 2 displays on the album and for all 3 songs, overwriting the proper covers for songs 1 and 3.

Obviously proper albums contain the same cover art for all songs included, but this seems like such a silly problem to have on any music player. The problem is also present on Spotify as well. The only place where it displays the proper album art is in the Windows Media Player, and even then, the album cover appears random and you can't change it without overwriting the covers of every single song in the volume.

This problem has persisted for years. I don't understand why there can't simply be an option to change the display image for an album without altering any of the tags of the songs themselves. Does anybody have a solution for this?",1569993828.0,0

From the Find My Mobile app I have disabled Remote Controls and Google Location Service, and stopped the tracking using the website (on both PC and on my phones browser) yet, like clockwork, 15 minutes later, my phone screen lights up to alert me that my phone is indeed still being tracked.

Samsung A20 Hard Reset,1,dbkbv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/dbkbv3/samsung_a20_hard_reset/,3,"I just ordered a new A20 since my old one is having major issues. It can't detect my SIM card (checked that the SIM is working on a different phone), it can't connect to WiFi, and it can't connect bluetooth either. It also can't accept a tethered mobile hotspot as well as it can't connect to my PC via Kies 3 to update or reset. Since I can't connect to the internet, I can't do a factory reset from the settings either.  


So here's the predicament as above is just stating what I've tried and what isn't working. I'm trying to hard reset by holding down the volume up button and the power button. Literally nothing happens when I hold down those buttons. Before asking, I have also reset/power down and let it rest many many times.  
Is there any final solution to hard reset/factory reset my phone before I send it back?",1569915121.0,0

Is it Sensible to run an I Phone and a Samsung Phone?,3,dbewaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/dbewaq/is_it_sensible_to_run_an_i_phone_and_a_samsung/,11,"Hi Everyone, looking for  little advice, I've only ever had Apple smartphones starting with an I Phone 5 and now with a 11 Pro Max and every I Phone in between.

I don't intend to switch away from Apple but have often thought I might like to try an Android phone just to try the different experience.

As a technology lover I'm really excited about the Galaxy Note 10 Plus as it's so radically different from the i Phones that I'm used to, that's the phone I'm thinking of getting. My logic is that I'll then have at the Flagship phone from both brands.

I totally get that this a very extravagant proposal but if I can afford it why not, I just see it as a new toy to play with.

The intended use for the Samsung will mainly be for travel, I travel quite a lot. Unlike the I Phone which has my entire life on it, including Bank Accounts and Credit cards on Apple pay etc I would only load Social media apps, E Mail, Maps, Netflix etc on the Samsung. The other main use would be the camera.

This way I won't have to worry too much about having different information on the two phones as the I Phone will remain my main phone.

So I have three questions,

Anyone out there running both operating systems and how do you find it?

How easy would it be to move photos/videos from the Samsung to my i Phone/I Pad/Macbook

Where do I go if I need support(with Apple its obviously the Apple Store)

Samsung and Lowes Need to Figure Out How To Preserve Client Satisfaction and Costs,0,dbcarj,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/dbcarj/samsung_and_lowes_need_to_figure_out_how_to/,4,"Scenario: one Saturday morning noticed our 15 year old fridge has failed - head to Lowes that evening and find a Samsung fridge that has been returned - verified no issues and working (on the tag) - buy it and bring it home.  Let it sit per normal for a few hours, plug it in and it pops an error code.  Follow all directions to reset and take out of demo mode.  Won't cool or freeze.  Spend Sunday going through all kinds of cycles to get working - notta.  Monday call Samsung support so they can fix the fridge - so sorry but we can't, you bought it less than 30 days ago at Lowes.   Call Lowes, would you please exchange out for a new one or sent repair rep - Nope.  All they wanted to do was pick it up, refund me and send off for repair.

This practice doesn't make good corporate fiscal sense to me plus down right was irritating to say the least.

1. you say I have a factory warranty for 12 months - but I don't really as Sumsung wouldn't fix it
2. you won't swap out with a new one as you gave me a couple hundred dollar discount on the clearance one
3. you spend resources to send a truck and crew out to pick up the fridge (we live 1 hour away)
4. you are then going to send off for repair

To me this is just a crazy practice!   What did I do next?  Went to Home Depot and bought a different brand.  And guess what, when my it's time to replace my two Samsung TV's and cell phone, LG is looking pretty darn good right now.",1569882245.0,0

Apples way of Recycling,0,daq2q8,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/daq2q8/apples_way_of_recycling/,4,"  

Apple has built a machine that is capable of recycling old or damaged phones more effectively than any other e-recycler. They call the 33-foot-long machine “Daisy”, and it can take apart any model iPhone for its raw materials. 

This process is more efficient because other recycling companies just smash old electronics and sift through it for raw materials, which is a wasteful practice to which the materials could be contaminated. 

Kyle Wiens, head of iFixit, criticizes Apple for making their devices hard to repair and being secretive about the technology used to create Daisy. He thinks that this is a PR stunt so Apple would appear to be environmentally conscious, while mass producing phones and using business tactics to encourage upgrades.

Lisa Jackson, Apples VP of environment, policy and social incentives, advocates for a “closed loop” of recycling at Apple and speaks to the public about Daisy’s success in recycling cobalt batteries, tin, and aluminum. Daisy will only work with iPhones currently, but Jackson say in the future it will recycle other apple products as well.",1569756736.0,1

Use third-party services in Shortcuts - Shortcutify TestFlight beta is out now !,59,dal4ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/dal4ax/use_thirdparty_services_in_shortcuts_shortcutify/,26,"Hi Reddit,

Over a month [ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/cqg0zn/i_make_app_which_integrates_third_party_apis_in/) I announced an iOS app that would integrate third-party services and devices to Shortcuts.  
Today I'm releasing first public beta which comes with an integration of Spotify, Sightengine, LIFX and Airtable.

# How it works

Most services you use daily provide what it's called API.  
API is the way to programmatically get access to service's features and data, which is why we can now play music on Spotify without having their app installed.  
Shortcutify integrates APIs and makes them available as Shortcuts actions, so you can manage and automate your favorite services without relying on official apps and without writing a single line of code.

# API Keys

Depending on the integration, you will need to obtain API key(s).  
It's a text of random characters that identifies you with the service and lets you use API without providing your username and password.

# Privacy

I made sure that the user's privacy is respected when using Shortcutify.  
That means that not a single byte is sent anywhere but to services you connect.  
There is no middle man, no analytics - nothing.  
All communications that happen between you and the service provider are, well, between you and them.

API keys are stored in iOS Keychain but please make sure that you keep them safe.  
If someone gets access to them they will be able to make changes on behalf of you.  
The good news is that if you ever feel that your keys are compromised you can always change/revoke them.

Shortcutify loads documentation of actions and set up instructions from shortcutify.app domain which also doesn't use any kind of tracking.

# Integrations

Currently, Shortcutify comes with 4 integrated services: Spotify, [Sightengine](https://sightengine.com), LIFX and Airtable.  
Each service has few actions that are available in Shortcuts.   
Number of actions and services are going to increase in next builds.  
Documentation about available actions and how to get API keys from services are also coming up in next builds.

You can sign-up for public beta here: [https://testflight.apple.com/join/npCqM6Lt](https://testflight.apple.com/join/npCqM6Lt)  
Please let me know about bugs, feature requests and what services you want to see integrated next.You can join Shortcutify [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcutify) here or have a chat with me in [Discord](https://discord.gg/6Xym23R) or follow updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shortcutify)

"Duple - Create your own Private Cloud at home - No complicated installation, no server needed - Looking for Mac users to try out our app! [Promo Saturday]",20,daj5ju,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/daj5ju/duple_create_your_own_private_cloud_at_home_no/,6,"Hey guys!

With my co-founder we built an app that gives you your full private Dropbox at home, with no complicated installation, and no server required. To store, sync, backup, share and access your files from anywhere.

The beta is available on Mac, so you're welcome to try it out, and if you have time let me know what you think! The interface is pretty cool!

Here's the website: [www.duple.io](https://www.duple.io/)

The documentation (explaining what is Duple, how it works, how to use it): [https://doc.duple.io/duple-documentation/](https://doc.duple.io/duple-documentation/)

And the beta page to download and use the app: [https://beta.duple.io/en/](https://beta.duple.io/en/)

It's a new kind of app that simplifies the concept of a private cloud. Basically, the entirety of your private cloud is contained inside a single folder called a repository folder. This folder can be stored anywhere: USB hard drive, NAS, cloud file storage, Raspberry Pi, etc... In order to use your private cloud, Duple needs to be able to access your repository folder. On your devices (where Duple is installed), you get a second folder called Duple (inside your ""My Documents"" folder). This folder contains the readable data, it's where you work with your private cloud: add, modify and remove your files there.

Functionalities include at least: Self Hosted, File Synchronization, File Versioning, Restoring Deleted Files, File Conflict Resolution, Backup (data at least in 2 places), Access From Anywhere, File Sharing (coming soon).

Your data is always at least in two places at the same time: inside the Duple folder (present on every desktop device where Duple is installed) and in the repository folder.

It's a super easy set up where you choose which storage to use and where your data goes. And it works like a Dropbox.

Duple was born out of personal need - we were originally trying to find a solution that offers actual privacy as opposed to the likes of Dropbox and Google drive, and at the same time more simplicity to use than what's currently available in the private cloud market (e.g. Nextcloud) with no complicated installation or configuration. So we developed Duple to have an out of the box simple-to-use tool that anyone can use, is self-hosted, and that gives you complete flexibility as it works with any storage. We saw a lot of people were interested in the idea and then decided to commercialise it.

If you have any questions about Duple, please don't hesitate to ask.

Thanks!",1569721126.0,1

The Apple CarPlay Dual Screen function in iOS 13 should be a setting,0,dahl5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/dahl5n/the_apple_carplay_dual_screen_function_in_ios_13/,16,"One of the new changes in Apple CarPlay is dual screen support, and its one of the biggest changes that I wish could be rolled back. My car doesn't have a touch screen panel, and I have to use a dial to navigate the CarPlay system. Because of this, doing a simple thing like opening up Google Maps to put on directions takes me so many more steps than it used to. I can't believe how dangerous this has been just for the last few days I have used it.

I was able to switch to Navigation with one click before, Google Maps would have the ""Go Home"" button right on the phone app, and that's it. Now, I have to open up Google Maps on the car, if the place I am going to isn't saved in recents, I have to find the app on my phone, open it, and do all of that. And it's not just Google Maps, it's the same thing with Spotify. I know these are third-party apps, but having that auto-switch to the same app on both screens is what I always liked about Apple CarPlay.

Not only is it actually more dangerous now, but they took in an aspect of Android Auto and integrated it into their own OS. Both have their merits, but Apple CarPlay was always a step above for me because it minimized the distractions you could have by opening multiple things at the same time. Some people may like this change, so Apple should have made the mirroring a setting and not a default into everything.",1569714035.0,1

We built a free app to help working professionals get structured feedback from their peers,14,dahgah,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/dahgah/we_built_a_free_app_to_help_working_professionals/,12,"&#x200B;

One of the things that annoys me is seeing that people don't give each other feedback often enough, or openly enough.**No feedback = no improvement = no progress.**

I kept bitching about it until I met a group of like-minded people who also want to help working professionals succeed.Now I find myself building an app that helps working professionals **get structured feedback** from their peers on what they should improve, and get pro tips on how to actually improve. Things like: presenting more clearly, handling debates more effectively, etc.The app is free to use and ad-free - I want to build a great user experience that makes it easy for everyone to improve themselves. Check us out and give it a try at: [iOS](https://apple.co/2OoYKZE) 

We are still in beta, and, of course, we are self-taught, so there are probably lots of unfound bugs. We are looking for comments/suggestions on what we can improve or tweak to make it better!

I believe everyone should have the right to get / give feedback to improve themselves - at no other cost than their personal effort.",1569713411.0,1

Am I the only person who wants updated iPad cameras every year on par with the iPhone?,0,dahali,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/dahali/am_i_the_only_person_who_wants_updated_ipad/,61,"I’ll premise this with the fact that I use my iPad extensively for work as well as pleasure.

I am an architect, and drawing/sketching on the iPad Pro 12.9” has replaced my physical notebook entirely. I also use it as a extremely light and mobile computer to plug into external monitor for client presentations. It’s also great to take with me when I do space surveys, one tool for drawing out a survey on and taking photos of a project site. Integration in the files app to my home server vis the Files app and cellular data, means I can sync photos and sketches to my offices from wherever I am. It’s just an extremely useful and lightweight computer for me.

This brings me to my last point, I’d like to be able to rely on my iPad Pro for architectural photography as well. I’d love for Apple to begin offering the same exact camera array each year on the iPad Pro as on that year’s iPhone Pro. This would allow me to set up my iPad on a tripod, and take the best possible photos possible of my space. Also, for me, having the better camera (better quality in dark spaces especially) on job walks is always extremely useful later for reference for me. Having the camera on my iPad rather than my phone allows me to upgrade my iPad every other year, and my iPhone only every three years or so. I simply use the iPad for doing actual work more than the phone, and thus want to upgrade more frequently.

Am I alone here, DAE use the iPad camera or wish to more?

EDIT: Folks misunderstood that I’d try to replace a professional photographer’s work with an iPad. All I really want is the option to take decent shots on smaller projects on my own, and on a device I already upgrade frequently.",1569712658.0,1

It literally takes a couple of seconds for music to start playing. I need to wait for a while for the playlist to get created.

When I get home, and having my data turn off and wifi on is such a quality of life change. Having shortcuts available in the sidebar on home screen is smart, I made a shortcut where I can access any of my most used apps in 2 buttons, no matter where their icon is located on the actual iPad. I just press “Apps” in shortcuts, it comes down with a list of apps I made, and once I tap one it launches.

I purchased a macbook from the apple website, paid for it with a credit card on there. I picked it up from the apple store about a week ago, but I just got an email saying that I didn't pick it up so the order has been cancelled and the money has been refunded to my account.

 I called apple, was on hold for 20 minutes, then I explained the situation to the CSR. She said she couldn't help me, but I would need to be transferred to another department. She started asking me if my computer was primarily used for business or personal use. I was frustrated by then, so I curtly responded, ""whats the difference? Can you please just transfer me to someone who can solve this?"" She said okay, and then transferrs me to a hold line, where I wait another 20 minutes. The next person I spoke with was in spanish, I think that the first CSR though I was rude and transferred my to the spanish call center to be cheeky. after vaguely communicating that I needed to speak english to the barely bilingual woman, I was finally transferred to the store that I bought it from, and the manager there told me to figure out what my credit card company says and to call her back once I figure it out, saying something about, ""we will need to start over""

My mind is blown. I'm not really a new iPhone user, I got the iPhone X back in 2017 as my first ever Apple device and I'm still really happy with it (which in itself is surprising, mainly because I would switch Android devices every 2 years, and here I am not even thinking about replacing my X). 

But what the hell Apple, you're updating a 4 year old phone. In this day and age that's ANCIENT. Rivalry aside, I WISH Android OS was not only more optimized (which is something that's hard to do on a fragmentes ecosystem) but had constant updates to phones this old, AND INSTANTLY. I was just watching a PocketNow video that said 13.1 is out, so I check for software updates and BOOM my X and 6s are updated. That would NEVER happen on my Android devices, maybe if I had a Pixel?

Facebook: No dark mode support, battery hog, bugs in the in app video player.

WhatsApp and Whatsapp Business: No dark mode support, no WatchOS app, no IPadOS app, no multi device login support. Telegram is leagues better, unfortunately no one uses it in my country.

Instagram: No dark mode support (seems to be in beta right now) no iPadOS support (heavily requested) 

Facebook Pages Manager: Perhaps the worst offender, the app is slow, riddled with bugs (at one point rotation didn’t work on my iPad Pro 10.5 for over 2 months, thus no keyboard support) 

Messenger seems to be handled by an entirely different team when compared to its siblings (then again maybe it is)

Can someone extensively test U1 Airdrop?,22,d91cdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d91cdn/can_someone_extensively_test_u1_airdrop/,10,"I don't have a U1 enabled iPhone yet, let alone access to a second one, but I am very interested in the new U1 chip and its future potential. 

In 13.1 directional Airdrop (enabled via U1) should be enabled and working when used with two U1 phones that are not on the same iCloud account. 

I am interested in all the details. Here is a list of what I think might be interesting and testable: 

* Does the phone need to be held in a certain way? (e.g. camera pointing at other phone / top of screen pointing at other iPhone)
* What happens if held in a different way?
* Is there a delay before other phone shows up?
* How much precision is needed? (Is rough direction enough?, what angle approximately?)
* How is the range?
* What about obstacles (walls) in between? 

If someone has two friends:

* How well can the iPhone discern at which other iPhone you are pointing? (at a distance of e.g. 3 meters (both other iPhones), how close can the other iPhones be from each other so that it's still reliably showing the correct one?)
* What happens if one iPhone is behind the other? (does it show the closer one first?)
* What happens if one is above the other? 

As you might imagine, I am trying to figure out how precise/accurate the U1 chip is. If anyone can come up with other ways of testing, I would like to hear about it.

Siri’s subtle voice changes have been incredible,17,d8wor7,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d8wor7/siris_subtle_voice_changes_have_been_incredible/,4,"I’m surprised I haven’t seen people posting about this. If the changes with Siri’s “personality” are indicative of where Apple is going with her, this could be the start of something pretty interesting. Does she still have a way to go as an AI? Sure. But, Apple appears to be working on giving her some actual personality.

If you haven’t “Hey Siri”ed in a while, give it a try. The ding-ding has been replaced with a very subtle “Mhm?” or “Uh-huh?” I haven’t been able to definitively work out whether she tempers her response based on the tone of your voice when you invoke her, but I’ll be honest - my jaw dropped when I first called her up and I got a nearly instant “Mhm?” It has become completely conversational to start an exchange with her. 

If Apple can enable some kind of follow-up the way you can with Alexa and then combine that with the always-available functionality in the gen 2 and (presumably) gen 3 AirPods, we could be getting a little closer to having an actual usable assistant in your ear at all times. We’re not even scratching the surface of “Her” territory (for those that have seen the movie) but having an actual voice response to calling Siri rather than a mechanical ding or beep is a very simple, yet incredibly powerful step in that direction. 

I could be making a big deal about nothing, but I really hope it’s more of a foreshadow into what’s to come instead.",1569404805.0,1

Arcade is making me regret the 64gb storage option.,20,d8ut7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d8ut7n/arcade_is_making_me_regret_the_64gb_storage_option/,44,"I think Apple really should have bumped the pro’s to at least 128gb alongside Arcade. It’s just too little storage if you plan to use arcade. Sure they may have had fewer people buying the larger tier storage in that case but, more people would be able to download the game and use the service. This is the first time in years I’ve felt 64gb (with iCloud) won’t be enough. With controller support and more full fledged games, people are going to need physical storage more than ever. You can either get the larger storage up front, constantly delete and re-download games (not very enjoyable experience), or just not subscribe in the first place. I’m surprised this wasn’t the year they bumped storage to go alongside the new service. Seems like a potentially missed opportunity to hook more people into their services. 

Anyways, does anyone know why the restocking fee at Best Buy is? Might be doing an exchange if I continue enjoying the new games.",1569394238.0,1

Snapchat seems to be accessing location even when denied access to it by using iOS’ system services,203,d8tgnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d8tgnj/snapchat_seems_to_be_accessing_location_even_when/,40,"Today a friend of mine noticed that even though he had turned Snapchat location settings to “never”, the app kept accessing location. 

These are the steps we took to replicate it (all tested on 12.3, 12.4,12.4.1 and 13.0)

Went to Settings>privacy>location services and proceeded with:

1. We turned all of other apps location services to “never”
2. Went to System Services and activated “Status Bar Icon” then turned off all the services that the system asks for besides “Significant Locations”

At this point we opened Snapchat again and tested it many times. Every single time we would open Snapchat the location arrow would pop up, every single time. No other app shows this behavior and no settings were changed. 

3. We went ahead and turned off “Significant locations” on System Services.

Now Snapchat would not show the location arrow and it didn’t seem to trigger any location services. 

Is Snapchat asking for extra permissions without the user knowing and accessing system settings? I thought that if an app was set to “never” they could actually never access location data.

2FA and Keychain problems on iPhone 11 with simple solution,0,d8r1g9,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d8r1g9/2fa_and_keychain_problems_on_iphone_11_with/,0,"TLDR - Had to set up 2FA to turn on Keychain on iPhone 11.  Got stuck after 2FA was on but unable to log back in to iCloud.  Simply restarting my phone at that point got me past the sticking point and allowed me to finish setting up 2FA, log in to iCloud and turn on Keychain.

Backstory is I struggled with setting up 2FA in the past getting stuck in the endless loop of trying to verify a device when no code was ever sent.  I generated codes in settings and tried every solution I could find online to get past it with no luck so I eventually reset my password and turned 2FA off.

Now, my new iPhone 11 is requiring 2FA to be on to turn on Keychain.  Thought I'd give it a try again and got 2FA turned on but got stuck and the iCloud log in.  I'd get the spinning wheel and would eventually get kicked back to the iCloud log in screen.  As mentioned above, a simple reboot of the phone at this point got me unstuck and allowed me to finish the process.  

Hope this helps anyone struggling with the same problem.  Cheers!",1569377584.0,1

Thoroughly disappointed in current Apple practice.,0,d8q9dn,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d8q9dn/thoroughly_disappointed_in_current_apple_practice/,66,"<>Allow me to apologize for the below rant.  It had been a long night of little sleep, repeating the same frustrating task. I had reached the point where _someone_ had to pay.   
When my new cables arrive tomorrow, and I again begin the migration, I will doubtless find the source of the problem is corrupt file buried inside a document folder.   

I could delete this example of reasons not to post when angry and a craftsman blaming his tools but I wrote it, I own it, good or bad.  I is what I is.    

Have a pleasant evening.<>

I just purchased a 2019 iMac.  Twenty-seven inch, Intel i9 Radeon Pro Vega 48 gpu, etc.  I encountered a few glitches migrating from my old machine which meant I would have to put the old machine in Target Disk Mode for the transfer.  No problem.  Then problem.

Target Disk Mode requires a Thunderbolt connection between the machines.  The new machine, $3,500 including tax does not include a Thunderbolt cable.  Therefore I must purchase a Thunderbolt cable for an additional $40 just to set up my new machine.

I have been an Apple user and supporter since I purchased my first Apple ][ back in the early Seventies.  Over the course of the last forty-plus years I have purchased a plethora of Apple products.  I have four Apple ][s in my garage, a 128k Macintosh, three MacPlus', five iMacs, three MacBook Pros, two MacBooks, four iPads.  I have gifted four iPads to my nieces and family.  As a computer professional I was responsible for the purchase of thirty Macintosh ci computers, two early Mac Portables.  I have advocated with friends and associates converting them from other formats to MacOS.

In all that time I have never been disappointed in an Apple product or with Apple support. Today I am not just disappointed, I am annoyed and more than a little angry.  I am annoyed that a necessary bit of hardware was not included with my new machine and that I will not be able to use my new machine until I have spent another fifty bucks.  I am disappointed that a corporation the size of Apple is too cheap to include a $6, their approximate cost, cable with a $3,500 purchase.

I hesitate to post this sort of rant because it just provides fuel for Apple Haters Anonymous.  Nonetheless, Apple has made a poor policy decision by not including a Thunderbolt cable with new machines.  They have left a long time Apple product user and advocate dissatisfied, unhappy and questioning his loyalty to a company and its products.

<edit>   
Look, I'm not going to keep arguing this point with a couple of folx whose heads are a hard as mine.  I am a long time Apple supporter and I am disappointed that Apple failed to include what I see as a necessary piece of inexpensive hardware with my purchase.  I am upset that I have to spend more money just so I ,hopefully, can get back to being productive. Particularly when I have no confidence that purchase will alleviate the problem. That's it.  'Nuff said.",1569374191.0,1

Location setting “while using the app” still sends location information when the app is closed and not running in the background.,70,d8a0al,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d8a0al/location_setting_while_using_the_app_still_sends/,40,"I have this app many of you may know “FlightRadar24”. 

Every time I drive by an airport I get a notification setting that says “Welcome to x airport”. 

The app is closed and cleared from memory. 

Location settings are set to “while using app”

So my question is, is that the expected behavior? 

I have emailed Apple security team at product-security@apple.com because I don’t understand how the app could get the location on the background if I specifically said not to do it. 

All they said was that they would investigate. (On March)

With iOS 13 out the issue is still happening. 

Is it just me not knowing how location services really works? Or an actual security issue?

Update: I have background app refresh off for that app

Some comments are not showing on my end but I got the notifications with what they said: Yes. There is an option inside the app for alerts on “Nearby Airport”. But shouldn’t it not work since the app is not being used and the notification settings are set to “only while using the app?”",1569289543.0,1

Things like multi-step ""morning routine"" shortcuts that access the weather news, directions, and many other things.

I've noticed that the shortcuts I use the most are only one or two actions long, letting me perform a task I do often quickly from the lock screen widget.

A few examples:

- ""Resume Overcast"".  My most used shortcut, which contains just a single action ""Overcast - Play"".  Let's me easily pick up my podcast where I left off if I get interrupted by some other audio source.
- ""Jot Down"".  Single action: ""Open Note: Notepad"".  Quickly open my scratch Note so I write something down.  This saves me needing to unlock the phone, find the notes app, navigate into a folder, and find the correct note.  That small friction would actually often prevent me from writing things down.
- ""I'm Home/I'm Leaving"" - both single actions that activate the corresponding HomeKit scenes.

These shortcuts are dead simple to create, but incredible useful.  Does anyone else have very simple, yet very handy shortcuts to share?",1569286337.0,1

Since updating on Thursday, I have had a dark mode keyboard burn into the screen on my iPhone X. 

[Here's a link to another post about it in the Apple forums](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250654753)

[Here's a twitter thread with at least 3 more cases.](https://twitter.com/b0xCH/status/1173708711820431361) I also found even more people posting about it on Twitter not contained in that thread. 

[Here is what happened to my specific phone. Also note that it is more prominent in real life. The pictures don't capture it as well. It is very obvious on light backgrounds.](https://imgur.com/dJwmqEg) I regularly use apps with white backgrounds, and this was never visible on my phone until I started using dark mode. I use snapchat constantly during the day and it's entirely visible there. I 100% would have noticed it, if it happened before iOS 13 Dark Mode.

You can also tell the keyboard burnt into my screen is a dark mode keyboard (black keys with white lettering) as opposed to a normal keyboard (white keys with black lettering). I do not use apps with dark mode keyboards. This was 100% the result of iOS 13. 

Just a PSA, be careful with dark mode if you are currently using an OLED equipped iPhone.
I had about an hour long chat with Apple support. They took all my information and photos and are sending it to their engineering department. He also made me a Genius Bar appointment for tomorrow so a tech can look at it, however I have no idea what the outcome of that will be.

So how did this nightmare start?

&#x200B;

Welcome to my 5 part saga...

&#x200B;

***Part 1***

Being the nerd that I am, I decide to take a look at the macOS Catalina beta and thought it would be fun to install to see what's going to be coming up soon for myself. Now, I do this every year with every new version of macOS and I have never had an installation issue. So I just set it to install and left it to do its thing. I went to get some groceries and I came back a couple of hours later to notice that the progress bar was stuck at about 90% with nothing much going on. So I forced a restart and waited. The same thing happened. I tried a third time, still no luck. So I started to panic and I was wondering when the last Time Machine back up was. Fortunately, I'd done one the day before whilst I was half asleep so I calmed down a little and called Apple Support. 

***Part 2*** 

I spoke to a very nice lady from Ireland called Julie who helped me sort out what the hell was going on. We booted into Recovery Mode and tried to get the beta to install again. Nothing happened. We tried Internet Recovery Mode and still, it wouldn't install. At this point, we agreed I should give up and downgrade to Mojave, so we fired up Internet Recovery Mode and tried to get it to revert back to Mojave and that's when things got weird. Macintosh HD also had a friend that we didn't know about, Macintosh HD - Data. After several minutes of us wondering why this was on the system, we just carried on and installed Mojave on to the regular Macintosh HD disk. And whatdoyaknow, it STILL didn't work. So now we had a problem on our hands. Through a series of workarounds, we finally got Mojave to install and Julie told me I would be able to restore my Time Machine backup. She then left with me some instructions as to what to do when it finally installed and hung up. Call duration 2 hours, 18 minutes and 34 seconds. She was amazing and I thank her for everything she did. However, what she wasn't to know is that my Time Machine backup wouldn't restore., due to a lack of free space. I start to panic again.

&#x200B;

***Part 3*** 

It was 11pm now and Apple Support was closed, so I had to use their Live Chat system instead which was fine, though a bit slow with responses. A guy called Daniel told me that I would be able to set up the system as new and then let iCloud do most of the work, with Migration Assistant filling in the gaps.

The same issue occurred as before, only this time *Migration Assistant* said it wouldn't be able to do it and asked me to uncheck some of the files to make it work. I unchecked everything I could, yet it still said there wasn't enough free space. I gave up and decided it would be better just to sort it out in the morning. I finally went to bed just after 2:15am. 

&#x200B;

***Part 4*** 

I woke up this morning with my Mac having downloaded some iCloud files in the background overnight and I had the majority of my stuff there but I still wanted to know what was up with this extra volume on the disk and I wanted to be able to restore some of my previous settings etc. I actually found it was easier to manually re-download a lot of my apps, not that I had many anyway, only about a dozen or so 3rd party apps. I call Apple Support again and got through to this wonderful lady called Moira.

She did Screen Sharing with me and worked out what the problem was that was preventing me from going through with the Migration Assistant; *Macintosh HD - Data*.

60.67GB of my 128GB SSD was taken up by this strange volume, which I never made and I never remember anybody else making. Moira then told me that it must have been made at some point so we clicked Get Info and it showed it was made in November 2015. Now, I remembered something happened with my Mac back then, but I couldn't remember exactly what it was. 

*And then it clicked... that data recovery guy.* 

At the time, I didn't have my external hard drive for Time Machine backups, and I unfortunately deleted a very important file which I desperately needed. I also didn't have documents in the cloud on either. In the end, mum hired a guy to come over and try to get him to recover the data. It was a long shot but we wanted to try. In the end, it was fruitless. But as part of the process, he created this extra volume on the disk, which just never got deleted. I also bought an external HDD after that experience. 

Moira and I combed through everything on this extra volume and transferred over everything that we needed. She then told me to back up again on Time Machine but it would take some time so she advised me to call back later. Call duration, 1 hour, 56 minutes and 14 seconds. 45.8GB backed up and just under 2 hours later, I called Apple Support again. 

&#x200B;

***Part 5*** 

This was the final call and I get put through to a Senior Advisor called Adam who coached me through what to do and was very helpful in explaining why data recovery people create partitions / volumes to find corrupted data and through Recovery Mode, we finally deleted Macintosh HD - Data for good. Nuked that dead weight of 64+GB. A restart and a few system tweaks here and there, and my Mac was finally running as normal again. 24 hours of hell and stress, all because Catalina didn't like me, it seems.

The moral of the story is that iCloud saved me and my Time Machine backup proved useful in saving me from potential disaster, though I didn't need that backup in the end really, aside from copying over some files manually. But above all else, being able to get this level of tech support for FREE really is something I can't get over. I was honestly expecting that I'd screwed up the disk so bad when the 4th attempt at installation didn't work that I'd have to send it off to Apple and it would cost me money I don't have.

But nope, these people all helped me and kept excellent logs of everything. I have come away from this experience a little more weary of macOS betas, but I did get over 60GB of internal storage freed up in the process. Every (i)Cloud, a silver lining.

A 1080p display on the iPhone 11 would’ve made this phone the perfect base model for this year’s lineup.,3,d7tul1,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d7tul1/a_1080p_display_on_the_iphone_11_wouldve_made/,44," (I apologies if this reads more like a rant than an actual discussion. I would like to read what's your take on this topic!)

Brief story: Two years ago I acquired the Jump! On Demand deal from T-Mobile that allows me to switch to any phone I’d like each month. Being both the iOS and Android enthusiast that I am, I usually switch every 6 months or so to the opposite OS, or whenever I really want to try a phone that I really like.

For context: The last smartphone that I got before switching to a Red iPhone 11 on Friday morning was a OnePlus 7 Pro. That phone really spoiled my way of thinking of what I can receive for less than a thousand dollars. Before you go ""How could you? The OnePlus 7 Pro is a better smartphone overall"" on me, I fully agree! The 7 Pro is hands down the best Android experience I've ever had, and one of the best smartphones I've had the pleasure to carry since its release. However, the one thing that made me switch to the 11 is what the 7 Pro ""lacks"" in a way: the camera. As someone who's finishing his bachelor's degree on the audiovisual production field, I can't stress enough when I say ""WHAT A CAMERA!"" Unfortunately, there's ONE thing that's nagging me when I switched to the current base model lineup of the iPhone. It's not the notch, it's not the bigger bezels, it's not even the lack of a 90hz refresh rate. It's the screen resolution.

I know there’s this ongoing battle on the community of “LCD is worse than OLED” or that “you can’t notice the difference between both”, but as someone who recently changed from an AMOLED display from the 7 Pro the difference is shocking as the resolution on the 11 looks too muddy in my eyes. Again, this isn’t even about the 90hz refresh rate on the display; even though I can notice the choppiness, I got used to 60hz fairly quickly. My issue is the fact that the iPhone 11 still carries the 800-something-p resolution from the XR for $699 when the OP 7 Pro offers A LOT more hardware wise at a lower cost. Even the Google Pixel 3a offers a 1080p OLED screen at $399 that looks sharper than the XR/11. Yes, you can make the debate that the targeted demographic (those who are going to switch from an iPhone 8 and below) “aren’t going to notice the difference”, but I ask you: Would bumping the screen resolution on the Liquid Retina display put a dent on Apple knowing that this phone will sell like hotcake? You could also argue that I should've gotten the regular iPhone 11 Pro, but I personally can't justify spending $300 more just for the display when, again, other smartphones carry a better quality display at a lower cost.

I’m not saying that Apple should’ve added an AMOLED screen on the 11 (although that would’ve been great honestly). However, I firmly believe that what would’ve made this phone the perfect base model for the current iPhone lineup was to bump up the screen resolution to 1080p. That way you can attract more customers that are switching from Android that are trying to save a few bucks, attract more iOS users that carry an iPhone 8 and below, and even attract current iPhone XR users for the better screen resolution and the added Ultra-Wide camera. Heck, they could’ve even left the $749 price tag and it still would’ve been a great offer to either enter or continue on the Apple Ecosystem.",1569203307.0,1

Clearing up the difference between Force Touch and 3D Touch,613,d7nvt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d7nvt4/clearing_up_the_difference_between_force_touch/,166,"Hi there!

I browse the sub almost daily, and for a while I’ve been noticing a common misconception taking place, and it’s even more frequent since the discussion around the 11 Pro models removing 3D Touch has started to take place.

I’ve seen a lot of comments here stating that 3D Touch and Force Touch are the same thing, when this is just flat out incorrect. They are similar technologies but 3D Touch is more advanced than Force Touch, and the difference is reflected quite well in their names.

Force Touch, as seen in the MacBooks, Magic Trackpad 2 and Apple Watch is simply a sensor for how deep the surface is being pressed in the z-axis. This is known and acknowledged by almost, if not exactly, everyone here. 

3D Touch also senses this pressure, which is where the similarity is. However, 3D Touch also accounts for x-axis and y-axis positioning on the display, as well as the z-axis depth. Or to put it more simply, **where** on the screen you’re force pressing. For example, to peek a certain link, or expose home screen actions for an app.

Force Touch does not account for that x and y axis positioning. When you Force Touch on your Apple Watch, it bears the same result no matter where on the screen you Force Touch. Hence 3D Touch is called so because it measures movement in 3 Dimensions, and Force Touch is called so because it only measures Force.

To answer some common points I see here:

*But I thought Force Touch only detects one level of pressure and 3D Touch detects more?*

This is completely **false**. Force Touch also detects multiple levels of pressure. You can test this yourself by Force Touching one of the scrubbers while watching a video on QuickTime, where the Fast Forward/Rewind has multiple speeds depending on how hard you press, or you can slowly Force Touch one of your Watch faces, and watch how it slowly retracts into the screen as you adjust the pressure level.

*But I was told they’re the same tech but with a fancy marketing name?*

Even if you disregard everything else in this post, this stance still makes no sense. If 3D Touch was just a marketing name, they would have moved the Mac and Apple Watch to this new name, as there would be no reason to not apply this same “marketing trick” to the other product lines.

I hope this clears up any confusion, and if you have any more questions, feel free to ask. If you can think of any common misconceptions I’ve missed, let me know, and I’ll add them to the post.",1569170913.0,1
PSA: Rejected for the iPhone Upgrade Programme? Read this,70,d7ns1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d7ns1v/psa_rejected_for_the_iphone_upgrade_programme/,32,"**TLDR; rejected by the iPhone Upgrade Programme, called Barclays who said that they'd manually approve the application if I tried again, then was able to refund the phone I'd bought outright and move over to the upgrade programme.**

I had an appointment to get the iPhone 11 Pro on the iPhone Upgrade Programme at the Apple Store (in the UK) on Friday. After I filled in all of the information, to my surprise, my iUP application was denied; I have a great credit score ('excellent' on Experian) and a good income. I ended up buying the phone outright rather than getting it on the upgrade programme.

I was worried about my credit score being impacted by a credit application denial, so I called Barclays who provide financing for Apple in the UK. They said that their credit dispute team would call back the next day with more details. I got a call on Saturday morning saying that they couldn't tell me why I had been rejected because that's part of their internal lending criteria.

However, they said that if I was to send them a copy of my bank statement and driving license then apply again, they would approve the application, so I sent that over to their underwriters. The dispute team said that before any information was submitted to them in the Apple Store as part of the upgrade programme, I should have the Apple Store call Barclays so that they could approve it manually as the information was submitted.

I went back to the Apple Store and asked them if they could refund me the cost of the iPhone so I could move to the upgrade programme, and they said that that's fine. Like Barclays requested, the Apple Store employee who was handling my case called Barclays before submitting any of my information, and Barclays manually approved the application as it was going through. So in the end, I was able to get onto the iPhone Upgrade Programme even though I had been rejected the day before.

Figured I'd post this here for anyone that might have had the same sort of experience. I can't say how this would have been handled outside the UK, but hopefully this will be helpful for someone either now or in the future with the next iPhone releases.",1569170079.0,1

iPhone 11’s UltraWide lens is fantastic, but the MoVI Cinema Robot and Osmo Mobile 1 & 2 show the rear motor housings [in the frame](https://twitter.com/bkbkbk/status/1175174829130956800?s=20). There’s no way to position the phone to get the housing out of there, limiting you to using the other two lenses. 

I went in to the Apple Store to pick up the Osmo Mobile 3 (I do pro video and really like shooting with gimbals). The motor housing is thin enough to avoid showing up in the UW lens but the motors can’t handle the phone. Osmo Mobile 3’s motor is allegedly rated to handle 200g, and the iPhone 11 Pro  is ~188g. The gimbal will hold it up, but it bounces while walking and will eventually fail. If you do a little bit of googling, you can find people complaining about the motors getting too hot, and completely not working on the 11 Pro Max. 

So, no gimbals for now with the ultra wide lens, and no Osmo 3 for the new lineup of phones, There’s a chance that DJI will update the Osmo Mobile 3’s hardware to handle it, but the devices that are on store shelves now aren’t going to do the trick.",1569151124.0,1

I bought an iMac G3, tangerine color, 6gb hard drive, running iMac 8.6. I spent $10. It came with the original keyboard and mouse and a CD case of 14 games for 3 to 8 years old and 2 CDs of some kind of artist software for kids. The older lady was going into a retirement home soon and her adult children were selling everything from the unit like a garage sale. They didn't want it anymore. 

Turning it on was really neat! I'm 31 and vaguely remember seeing these colorful computers in elementary and middle school around 2000 or so. The screen popped a lot, probably because it hadn't run in years. That finally stopped. The case is a bit dirty but nothing a good wipe won't fix up. Everything works great. It's snappy. The hard drive is only 14% full. 

I don't know what I'm doing on this old thing lol. I grew up only using windows. I figured out how to play a game from the CD and play a classical music CD on the player. It sounds perfect. It's a really neat 39lb paperweight lol.

I thought about selling it on Craigslist but I changed my mind. My daughter is under 2 years old and I've decided to give it to her someday to learn on.

Hey!

I build a Reddit client for iOS called [Apollo for Reddit](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575). In a sentence, it's an iOS-focused Reddit app (not crossplatform, iOS only) that's an alternative to the official app with the goal of being speedy, comfortable to use, great media browsing, and just the best iOS has to offer in general. I loved Alien Blue, and wanted to build something as powerful and awesome as it, but with the goal of feeling even more like an iOS-first experience. [Here's a link](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575)

I started working on Apollo right after I finished working at Apple in the summer of 2015, worked on it through 2017 when it finally got released, and it's been my full time job since.

I love that I can build such a fun and exciting app every day, and no bullshit, it's only because of the support of the Reddit Apple community that I've been able to. There's no ads, no investors, only optional support from you guys to sustain the app. It's built solely with the goal of making Redditors happy and I do my absolute best to be active in the community and base the app around its feedback.

So as a thank you, and to celebrate many sleepless nights working on the iOS 13 update that's now live, I wanted to do a lil giveaway open to anyone in the community. I'm not Unbox Therapy so it's not a pick up truck full of iPhones, but I thought giving away an iPhone 11 Pro (or Pro Max) could be a fun way to say thanks (or a regular iPhone 11 if that's what you want).

### How do I enter?

Just comment and you're entered. If you want something to comment about, uhh, help me name [the Apollo mascot](https://apolloapp.io). You have [24 hours](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=how+long+until+4+pm+september+22+2019+halifax%2C+nova+scotia+time).

### What do I win?

An iPhone 11 Pro or Pro Max or regular 11 (maybe you want that nice red). 256GB. Color of your choice.

### Any rules?

Your Reddit account has to have been created before this thread was posted to prevent a bunch of duplicate accounts posting. Also I'll PM you if you win, you have 48 hours to respond to the PM (will go out Monday) or it'll go to the next person. All countries accepted so long as it's not impossible to get it to you.

### What's in Apollo's iOS 13 update?

Like I said Apollo's really focused on being the best iOS has to offer and really feeling at home on the platform. iOS 13 brought a bunch of really cool stuff, so I wanted to support as much of it as I could on day 1. So Apollo has support the (finally) system dark mode, the new haptic touch context menus, super fast launch times, there's Siri Shortcuts support so you can say [""normie garbage"" and have it open r/dankmemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/90b66h/yo_is_apollo_gonna_support_siri_shortcuts/) or just build cool systems in the Shortcuts app in general. There's also multi-window support on iPad which is super cool. Hell, iOS 13 even supports PS4 and Xbox One controllers now so I added support for those. I really wanted to build something that didn't feel like a cross-platform, half Android /Material Design mixture, but instead feels like it was built from the ground up for iOS.

### Should I give Apollo a try? I don't mind the official app tbh

The official app's really cool, built by some super smart people, I even got to meet some of the engineers at WWDC this year. Utmost respect. It's kinda like a car though, you might use your car, it might get you from point A to point B fine, it's a solid enough car, why switch? Well, you might sit in a friend's car, find it just a bit more comfortable, maybe a bit speedier, sportier, appreciate some of the design choices better, and overall just find it a more enjoyable experience. Apollo Car has a really awesome media viewer, fast swipe gestures, speed, GIF scrubbing, a subreddit Jump Bar, really great comments view, and much more that you really have to see first hand. On top of this, in this analogy the competing car is free, [so why not try it](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575). :P 

Oh here's a quick album of screenshots I put together: https://imgur.com/a/UO2J10s (There's light mode too if you're into that!)

### I have an idea for your app!

Sick, that would make for a great comment, please do. :D I genuinely build the app solely planned around community feedback, so I'd greatly appreciate it!

iPhone 11 Pro and Pixel 3 Camera Comparison and Brief Thoughts,0,d7efhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d7efhz/iphone_11_pro_and_pixel_3_camera_comparison_and/,8,"[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/baVDP7w)

My Takeaways:

* The iPhone still can't match the Pixel when it comes to fine details like hair/fur/skin, nor can it freeze motion as well.
* The Pixel struggles to grab focus in the dark, the iPhone doesn't hesitate.
* The iPhone still has a weird brown/orange hue to photos, but not as bad as previous models. 
* The ""oilpainting"" effect from too much noise reduction is pretty much gone from the iPhone. Thank you!
* The iPhone still overexposes, and really lacks contrast/shadows. It just kind of blanket brightens the entire image which makes it look washed out.
* The Pixel's front camera is a lot better than the iPhone's, particularly in handling dynamic range.
* Pixel night photos look more natural to me, the iPhone seems to just max out the sharpening slider which results in more detail but looks really bizarre. Very Samsungish.
* The iPhone's ultrawide camera is bad. Super soft even in the best lighting, looks like a potato in the dark.
* The iPhone is obviously more versatile. Better video and more cameras is very useful.

I really hope Deep Fusion can deliver a big jump in detail, because it still just isn't there compared to the Pixel.",1569120273.0,1
Introducing SongSync: My project to emulate Spotify Connect for Apple Music (xpost from r/AppleMusic),53,d7ec95,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d7ec95/introducing_songsync_my_project_to_emulate/,9,"Hey everyone! I've heard a lot of complaints from people who switched from Spotify to Apple Music and miss the Connect feature. I know this because I'm one of those people, which is why I'm working on a new service called [SongSync](https://www.songsync.online/).

&#x200B;

**What is it?**

Basically Spotify Connect for Apple Music. It will let you view what's playing on your other devices, control playback of other devices, and transfer playback from device to device.

&#x200B;

**How does it work?**

I'm writing a suite of apps for macOS, iOS, Android, and Windows that will run on your devices, talk to the SongSync server, and fetch song updates from the device that is currently playing. The app on the currently playing device sends the info for the currently playing song to the server for the other devices to view. If this is too vague, there's more in-depth info on the [demo page](https://www.songsync.online/demo.html).

&#x200B;

**If I use this, is my data safe?**

Yes! The point I want to get across most is that this service (plus the apps) collects absolutely no data other than what you explicitly give it. The extent of your stored data is: your username, password, currently playing song (plaintext info), and linked device names. You won't even need to provide an email address.

&#x200B;

**When will I be able to use it?**

It's still in the incredibly early stages, and progress is being made faster than I could have imagined. It's not ready to launch yet, but I plan on opening it up for beta testing in the future. I'm incredibly proud of the work I've done so far, and I'd love to hear your thoughts and get some community input. Let me know what you think, and what you'd want to see in a service like this!

So browsing with cookies completely disabled makes it impossible to use certain sites so that is not an option.

Why I use Siri more than Google Assistant.,6,d797pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d797pw/why_i_use_siri_more_than_google_assistant/,3,"The Internet is an echo chamber that tries to slap the notion that one device or service is objectively better than everything else. That’s the same thing happening with digital assistants.

Wherever you go in the Internet, Everbody seems to just put a stopmark that Google Assistant is better than other assistants in every way. In real day to day usage it’s hardly the case. So let’s the obvious thing get out of the way. Google Assistant does machine learning much better than every assistant on the planet. You get much better contextual outputs with it. The problem is that no assistant in the world is perfect in machine learning. The occasional mistakes makes us less motivated to try it again day to day basis. Siri is the most notorious assistant to make these mistakes. So why it happened that I use Siri more day to day than Google assistant on my OG pixel?

The main strength of Siri lies in what was introduced with iOS 12. That is Siri shortcuts. For those of us who don’t know it’s an automation platform to control and integrate processes within iOS and its apps. Android also has an automation app called Tasker which albeit provides more control over the android ecosystem. There are two major problems with Tasker....No integration with Google assistant and No massive library of third party apps that supports the same. You can’t directly trigger tasker commands through assistant and the commands are although integrated with android well, there are only a handful of third party apps that supports it.

It’s been a year since iOS 12 was introduced and there a lot of developers that supports shortcuts. One example is one of the banking Apps that I use. They have many implements with shortcuts including a big one where I just say the phrase “Account Balance” to Siri and it fetches the actual balance in my account instantly without me needing to go to the app. One more example is a small third party food delivery app in my country(which Google would never partner with to bring this into Google Assistant) where I can track the delivery of my order by just asking Siri and it would bring the ETA for the same. Another one is one of the health apps, where I need to go to the app, find the section to log my water intake and be done with it. With shorcuts, I can directly log my water intake through Siri and it will send the data to the app. These are little things but they are helpful in avoiding extra steps. And these are just scratching the surface. You can visit r/shortcuts where they have many amazing shortcuts including my favourite one where If you are in Amazon app and looking for a product, you can simply click the share button of the product and select the shortcut which helps you see the price change in the product for past time periods.

I know Google Assistant and Alexa both have similar features, but the problem they are not tied in with an automation app and ecosystem of third party apps that supports them are severely limited.

I know this is a long post. But these are the reasons why I use Siri more often than ever before. If you are happy with Google assistant or whatever digital assistant you use, good for you. But we need to stop saying that one digital assistant is objectively better than than other. People have different needs and different assistants have strengths and weaknesses.",1569093349.0,1

Tell me what you think about it.

[See here for some screenshots.](https://imgur.com/a/6f35RkF)

Hey /r/apple,

I have recently been working on a small app to help me manage my daily expenses. Originally, I started building this for personal use only but now I am wondering if others may find it useful as well.

The app essentially allows you to track your expenses and simply shows you by how much you exceed your personal daily budget. But that’s not all: By allowing you to carry over unspent budget day-by-day, the app gives you the exact amount you are allowed to (over)spend. This allows you to keep a daily budget over time (e.g. within a month), while generally not being too restricted.

If you’re bound to strict financial requirements, just like me, this allows you to better keep track of you actual spendings throughout the month. As someone who likes to keep an eye on such numbers, this system has helped me a lot. In fact, my personal experience is that the app often provides sort of a psychological relief, as to where I am actually standing with my budget.

For my personal use, the app is functional and provides most of the features I’ve planned (e.g. fast entry of new expenses, multi-currency support).

My personal experience with other budgeting apps was that they provide lots of functionality which can be very overwhelming at times. Now, I am looking forward to your feedback! Is this something that you would consider useful or are you well-served by other budgeting apps?

Depending on your responses, I would consider putting in the extra effort and polish to make the app available on the app store.",1569085834.0,1

iPhone 11/Pro: Capture Outside the Frame is content aware!,110,d6zkhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d6zkhf/iphone_11pro_capture_outside_the_frame_is_content/,34,"I totally discovered this by accident.

So there’s a feature called Capture Outside the Frame that will basically use a wider camera than your current one and take a picture on top of your picture. So if you’re using the wide camera, it will use the ultra wide camera and get more “image” outside your frame and basically merge the two together (I assume). You can then go into crop editing and actually zoom out from your original picture.

No big deal, pretty sure this was on the keynote.

However this feature actually turns itself off when it detects it doesn’t need it. I discovered this by accident when I took a picture indoors and wondered where my “extra image” went when I couldn’t zoom out. I swore I turned it on (and it was).

I then had a light bulb moment. This feature is content aware! To test my theory, I went outside, took a picture of my backyard, and ~~viola~~ voila, it captured more stuff outside of the frame I was using!

Edit: it defaults off, turn it on in camera settings. Also apparently you need HEIC format turned on instead of jpeg.",1569035221.0,1

"PSA: You can accidentally order a phone with the ""iPhone Payments"" program instead of ""iPhone Upgrade Program"" by mistake (I did).",207,d67w0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d67w0e/psa_you_can_accidentally_order_a_phone_with_the/,72,"Both me and a friend (iPhone X owners) accidentally placed an order with Apple's new financing thing instead of the iPhone Upgrade Program.

In my case, I was already on the iPhone Upgrade Program but did not upgrade last year. I ordered an iPhone 11 by going to the Apple Store app and clicking the prompt to ""Upgrade this Phone"". I then followed the prompts which include financing through Citizens One so I assumed I did it correctly.

In my friend's case, they weren't on the iPhone Upgrade Program but wanted to trade in their iPhone X.

You still get prompted from Citizens One, which supports both programs, so it's very hard to tell what is going on.

I checked out the current flow and you can easily get directed _from the iPhone Upgrade Program_ page onto a flow that lets you buy on the iPhone Payments program or pay in full only, with no upgrade program option.

Here's a screenshot of Apple's (current) website showing this flow being totally broken and confusing:

"[iOS/iPadOS 13] ""App would like to use Bluetooth"" - What is this, and what should you do?",185,d605ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d605ql/iosipados_13_app_would_like_to_use_bluetooth_what/,38,"I just thought I'd make a quick post about this given that iOS 13 will be released tomorrow, and this question will come up a lot. 

The first time you open an app after a fresh install, or update an app, you will be met with a pop up that looks like [this](https://imgur.com/a/fq1hNTp). 

The reason that apps are now asking for permission, is because Apple is giving users more control of what apps get access to. IIRC, the last time Apple implemented something like this was for Apple Music (basically, allowing apps to allow your Apple Music songs, data). The latest moves are Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. 

Bluetooth, however, it's something that a lot of apps use, for almost anything. It goes from setting up and managing accessories, discovering Chromecast devices, knowing whether you are connected to a car or not. It doesn't affect the audio, so if you disable Bluetooth access for say, Spotify, audio will play just fine on your Bluetooth device but some app features will be disabled (more below)

The problem now, is that apps are just asking you to give access to Bluetooth, but aren't explaining why exactly. Until apps get updated to provide information, I'd thought I'd make a general list of apps that will ask for Bluetooth access and why they want it. 

Just a note, for Chromecast-enabled apps: In order for a guest to find your Chromecast device, they need Bluetooth enabled for the app to find it. This info is all laid out on [Google's Developer page](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/ios_sender/ios13_changes)


Here is the list:



Category (or individual apps) | Why?
---|---
Navigation Apps| Used to track your car's location and tell you where you parked; Used to enable car-view (applicable in some apps)
Spotify | Used to enable [Car-View](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/16/18185644/spotify-car-view-now-testing-android-simple-controls)
Video Apps | Used for Chromecast casting
Facebook | Used for Chromecast
Google app | Used for Chromecast
Amazon | Used to setup [Dash Wand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202084170)
Tile, Fitbit | Used to connect to accessories
Google Home, other smart home apps | Used to connect to accessories
Snapchat | Spectacles

Hopefully you get the idea on why some apps request Bluetooth. In the case of [iBeacons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon), in order for an app to get access to your location via beacons, the app needs location (GPS) permissions, not Bluetooth so this won't be affected by you deciding to deny Bluetooth permissions to an app. 


Are some apps requesting for tracking? Could be. We don't know. There is no evidence. Could be happening though, or not. Up to you to think about it. Though, [Apple is emailing developers to let them know that they need to tell you why they want Bluetooth](https://blog.estimote.com/post/186160021855/get-ready-for-ios-13-bluetooth-and-location), so hopefully you will be able to tell when an app is lying about why they need BT and you figure out whether they are tracking you, or not.",1568852473.0,1
What are your thoughts on Apple News+?,30,d5zgr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d5zgr6/what_are_your_thoughts_on_apple_news/,57,"Without any success, I've been trying to find a way to deal with the overwhelming amount of information, news and news outlets on the internet. First, to avoid being in an echo chamber or having my opinion controlled by companies who pick and choose what content gets pushed over others, I tried creating my own RSS feed. That didn't work out. In order to access the news outlets that I wanted I had to pay around $200 /month, which is not realistic in any sense.

So, I decided to give it a chance to Apple News+. It seemed like a great deal... $9.99/month for access to The Wall Street Journal (which I pay anyway), LA Times, The Atlantic, The New Yorker, Bon Appétit, National Geographic, etc.

I've been using it for 2 days now and I'm not sure what I'm paying for:

a) They advertise full access to The WSJ but there are a lot of stories and articles missing. If I see an article online, I can't search this article on the app to read it.

b) Not sure what algorithm Apple uses to show you ""relevant"" articles, but it seems that Left-leaning outlets get pushed over others. I've added to my interests 10 right-leaning outlets and 10 left-leaning outlets, only the latter shows 85% of the time. I thought Apple's ""machine learning"" experience was not like that of Google.

c) I don't know what I'm paying for: I've sent links to my friend and to my other iPhone (on a separate Apple ID) that without an Apple News+ subscription and every single link is accessible. 

PD: I'm not trying to have a debate about politics and/or the reliability of news outlets. Let's focus on the content, functionality and the ability of Apple News to get each one of us out of our echo chambers.",1568849542.0,1

[SOLVED] How to shop tax free for extra-community Europe visitors at Apple Online?,2,d5z0i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d5z0i9/solved_how_to_shop_tax_free_for_extracommunity/,2,"I was with this big problem of how to ask for a tax free certificate when buying online at [apple.com/es](https://apple.com/es) or in any EU country. It is well known that if you go and buy it in-store you easily get the tax free certificate but none told how to do it when buying online.

After calling Apple, they made it easy to me and explained step by step how to do it. My explanation is how to do it in Spain but I guess the process is the same in every EU country so I wrote it generalized.

**So the protocol is the following:**

1- Buy the device (as for billing address leave the country as it is, zip code=00000 and complete all the other address blank-boxes with the residence address from your country). 

**Note:** You should buy it AT LEAST 1 week before traveling because the following steps require a couple of working days and you may run out of time.

2- Call post-sales department and ask for the DIVA *(this is how it is called in Spain, for other EU countries you may need to do some research)* form and certificate. (For Spain it is +34-900-150-503)

3- Complete the DIVA form.

4- Show it at customs in the last EU country you visit, before you leave.

Then wait and get your refund.",1568847621.0,1

My experience with Apple Live Chat Support has been atrocious. 5 different times this week.,29,d5rlx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d5rlx8/my_experience_with_apple_live_chat_support_has/,32,"This conversation basically sums up my experience with Apple's Live Chat now. Excuse my frustration in the chat, but this was the 5th person I've talked to in two days. [https://imgur.com/a/8BKxcuI](https://imgur.com/a/8BKxcuI). 

Regarding the first message of the convo above, they DO allow gift cards + trade ins, but on the desktop store, not the mobile store. So their answer is WRONG. An apple person I spoke to on the phone cleared that up.

Look, I've been excited to get this new iPhone 11 Pro and pay for it with my new Apple Card. I'm going all in on the Apple ecosystem. But this shit is bringing me close to the edge.

I've always felt confident with Apple Live Chat, but as of recently I was almost to the point of cancelling my order. Either Apple is using bots that closely mimic real english but dont understand context, or they are outsourcing their Live Chat to people who can't speak English as their first langauge, because it has been like talking to a pull-string doll.

They have not addressed my individual concerns, they speak very strangely, none of my issues got solved and their answers are generic garbage. I had an issue with the mobile app, and they gave me the number for Goldman Sachs for help with the Apple Card, what?!

I've solved some issues myself, and when I did, I would explain to them what the solution is and they reply ""that is correct!!"". I tested them one time and gave them a WRONG solution, and they STILL replied ""you are correct!"". I feel like it is a complete joke now and you have to call up to get a real person. Anyways, just wanted to vent my frustration, I hope they deal with this soon and get a new vendor or something.

1. Jealously. Apple products are expensive. Some can't afford it so they hate on it.

2. Want to be a contrarian. Don't want to be a 'sheep'. But the funny thing is there are way more Android users then iPhone users. So who really is the sheep?

3. Apple charges way too much for too little. Not so fast. Lets look at profit numbers from Apple, Microsoft, and Google.

This is 2018 FY results:

Apple: $266 billion sales. $59 billion profit. 22% profit margin.

Microsoft: $126 billion sales. $39 billion profit. 31% profit margin.

Google: $137 billion sales. $31 billion profit. 23% profit margin.

As you can see Apple has the LOWEST PROFIT MARGIN. For every dollar of sales Apple gets 22 cents of profit. That does not seem unreasonable to me. Although Apple products can be expensive they are also more expensive to make. That is why iPhones last way longer then Android phones on average. Supporting 4+ year old devices like the iPhone 6s cost money.  Cost money to build and maintain iOS. Cost money to run retail stores. Cost money to create something like TouchID, FaceID, Apple watch, ect. Other companies like Samsung can just reverse engineer what Apple does. That is much cheaper.

So saying Apple charges too much is also a flaw. Because out of the big 3 companies they have the Lowest profit margin.",1568760915.0,1

The iPhone 11 Pro is a Good Upgrade and NOT Iterative IMO,0,d5fuw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d5fuw8/the_iphone_11_pro_is_a_good_upgrade_and_not/,60,"EDIT TITLE: The iPhone 11 Pro is a Good Upgrade and NOT *Completely Iterative IMO

Before you downvote, hear me out. If you disagree, fair enough, but at least leave a comment saying why you disagree along with your downvote.

So I've been seeing a lot of comments on Reddit and YouTube saying that the iPhone 11 Pro is iterative. I have to say I disagree. I think the reason why not a lot of people are impressed with the iPhone 11 Pro is either because:

a) everybody knew what to expect because of the leaks, so there weren't really any major surprises; or  
b) there wasn't a **complete overhaul** in the redesign.

Features and improvements:  
**1. Display** \- the display is more energy efficient. It has a better contrast ratio and more consistent color across the entire panel. It's also brighter with 1200 nits peak brightness and 800 nits sustained brightness which is extremely useful when out in the sun during the summer (which is like a quarter of the year).  
**2. Speakers** \- spatial audio and dolby atmos support. As somebody who uses their phone as their main device for media consumption, this will be a nice feature to have.  
**3. Wireless** \- Faster LTE and WIFI-6 are also nice features to have. Considering that people are holding onto their phones longer, these are nice additions to have as users will have phones that are able to take advantage of these technologies when they become ubiquitous.  
**4. Face ID** \- Now that Face ID is faster (on top of iOS 13) and works at further distances and a greater range of angles, this is hugely convenient given that Face ID is used potentially thousands of times every month. As somebody with an iPhone XS Max, I can honestly say this is a welcomed upgrade.  
**5. U1 Chip** \- it's only being used for AirDrop right now, but soon enough it will be able to let you find lost items by pointing you to the direction they're in... even indoors. This will drastically cut the amount of time you spend looking for lost items.  
**6. A13 Chip** \- more powerful, more efficient. This will not only help with heat, but gaming and AR apps will run smoothly well into the future even as hardware demands increase.  
**7. Battery** \- the more power-efficient display and A13 as well as the increased battery capacity will mean battery life is significantly increased. I end the day on about 20% with low power mode turned on with my iPhone XS Max as long as I'm not on the phone too much, especially when out all day and cellular data is sucking up battery. But with the battery life improvements that Apple is claiming, I don't think the battery will be something I would need to give any thought and I could use my phone freely when I'm out all day. Battery management is a huge burden to be lifted because all I want to do is just go about my day without having to worry about when and for how long to use my phone.  
**8. Cameras** \- we'll have to wait until the reviews are in to see how much the cameras have improved but night mode shots, the ability to *seamlessly* switch between any lens as well and being able to recover erroneously cropped shots all seem like extremely useful camera upgrades.

Now I know that everyone wanted the iPhone 11 Pro to have a drastic redesign because that would make the phone feel new. I'm with you, I wanted a drastic redesign too. Although Apple didn't completely change the look top-to-bottom, it doesn't mean that the design is the same. The back looks completely different which means half of the phone has been redesigned. Frosted finish, triple cameras, repositioned logo, new color, everything about the back has changed as much as it possibly can. Did the notch get smaller? No. Are the frames flat like the iPad Pro or iPhone SE? No. But that doesn't mean that the iPhone 11 hasn't been redesigned.

Now I would have liked to see a 120Hz refresh rate on the display, a USB-C port, in-display Touch ID and Apple Pencil support among other things, but just because these features aren't included, it doesn't mean that this is a 'boring' or iterative upgrade. The 8 features I mentioned above are good additions and have genuine use cases and make positive contributions to the overall user experience. And at the end of the day, that's what it's all about. A phone can have all of the bells and whistles, but the important thing is the user experience and the use cases the new features have.

EDIT: if you think the new features are iterative, go ahead and think of groundbreaking new features and list them in your comment. If you can’t think of any, it’s wise to not disregard the new features of the iPhone 11 Pro because they are pretty good.",1568749951.0,1

It is one thing for a content provider to decide not to sell something anymore, it’s another thing to remove content you already purchased.

When I told Apple customer service today about it, they basically told me to rebuy the album after one of my songs on the album was no longer available for redownload. 

I find this incredibly dishonest and disappointing from a company I have invested so much money in. I have done all the troubleshooting and it all came down to Apple just telling me to rebuy the album. I cannot rebuy the song because the song is only available if you purchase the album.

>The app was announced at Apple's WWDC 2015 developer conference. It was released alongside the iOS 9 release on September 16, 2015, for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. At launch, the app was only available to users in the United States, but within a month had become available to users in Australia and the United Kingdom.

Canada was added in 2019 I believe. 

Is News just something Apple isn't interested in that much? I can't be critical of Apple's 'Services' in general because [most of them are in many more countries](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/), but News seems just ignored. And I know people will say it's difficult to 'make deals' with regional news organizations and that's the reason, but especially for the non-paid version of Apple News, I find it hard to believe these deals are so challenging that after 4 years, Apple has only managed to negotiate with news providers in 4 countries. It's not as if regional licensing and related issues do not exist for music, movies, etc., and Apple seems capable for providing content for their international users for these mediums.  

Maybe there just isn't much demand for it, but it's something I've wanted to try (in a functional local way, not with the workarounds that let you view US news outside of the US or whatever.) It's just surprising that it's STILL in only 4 countries. Not in continental Europe or Japan or anywhere else.",1568597716.0,1

PSA: Microsoft Office may not be free to use on the new iPad 7th generation,112,d4hc50,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d4hc50/psa_microsoft_office_may_not_be_free_to_use_on/,73,"Microsoft has a policy where only devices with a screen size of 10.1"" or smaller can use Microsoft Office to view, create and edit files for free. On devices with a screen larger than 10.1"", Microsoft Office can only be used to view files for free, while a valid Office 365 subscription is required to create and edit files. This policy applies across Windows, Android, Chrome OS, iOS and iPadOS. Note that only Word, Excel and PowerPoint are subject to this policy, while OneNote and Outlook are completely free to use on all devices regardless of screen size.

The iPad 7th generation, which Apple just announced a few days ago, has a screen size of 10.2"", which is just above the 10.1"" limit. This means that you may have to pay for Office 365 if you want to use Microsoft Office on it. This is definitely something you have to consider if you are planning to get the iPad 7th generation. The previous iPad 6th generation had a screen size of 9.7"", so Microsoft Office can be used for free on it.

Personally, I think Apple made a bad decision with the iPad 7th generation. Increasing the screen size from 9.7"" to 10.2"" really doesn't make any significant difference on the usability of the iPad, instead it only causes problem with Microsoft Office. Apple should have kept the 9.7"" screen size, especially when they admitted themselves that the 9.7"" iPad is the most popular. Instead, Apple could have upgraded the A10 processor to A11.

Apple says that the iPad 7th generation is economical, but it may not be so economical after all if you have to pay for Office 365. Microsoft Office is used by many iPad users, and Apple hasn't made significant improvements to iWork that could make it a viable replacement for Microsoft Office.

Of course, considering that the difference is just 0.1"", it's possible that Microsoft may allow the iPad 7th generation to have Microsoft Office for free. Google's Pixel C tablet also had a screen size of 10.2"", but as it turned out, Microsoft Office can actually be used for free on it, and this remains the case until now. However, we must not assume that it will be the same for the iPad 7th generation. It's best to wait for Microsoft to make a public statement about this.

Confusingly, when the iPad 7th generation is released on 30 September, Microsoft Office will probably function for free on it initially. This is because the Microsoft Office apps are not yet designed to detect and work with its 10.2"" screen. However, Microsoft can fix this anytime they want by updating the Microsoft Office apps.",1568560803.0,1

apple alarm rant,1,d471sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d471sd/apple_alarm_rant/,40,"the alarm system on apple devices is terrible — i find that at minimum once a month (usually more) my alarm won't go off.

this has happening to me over the past 6 years and it's happened across four different apple devices: ipad mini, iphone 5c, iphone 6 and now my current iphone 8.

it happens in all different ways, most of the time a family member will wake me up & i'll immediatelt check my phone to see my screen normal & the alarm turned off. it has happened occasionally where i turn on the phone and my screen flashes 'alarm' but no sound, nor did the screen light up on its own.

this i just a straight up rant bc i've just about had it, especially after i missed a very important and urgent appointment that i ended up having to reschedule at a different place, all because iphone alarms aren't reliable whatsoever.

and yeah, i know, i should've learned my lesson the first time it happened & bought another alarm clock, but my issue is, why should i have to? i spent hundreds of dollars on this thing, why should i need to have a backup for a service it provides me? if i pay this much money, i just expect my product to work, y'know?

[edit] i know about the 'change volume with buttons' setting. this happens to me regardless of whether or not that setting is turned off, i've tried both because i originally didn't know if that setting correlated directly with alarms",1568505713.0,1

I'd graduated from film school not too long before getting it, and figured what the hell? Maybe I'll shoot a lil' something on it just to see what the deal is. Wound up being a 3min horror short based off some old creepy-pasta. Here it is!

[Close Enough - Vimeo Link](https://vimeo.com/91666969)

I'll try and go over some of the more notable aspects of the film:

* Not only did I shoot the short on an iPhone, but the photos in the short were actually shot with the phone too! I think I made them with Hipstagram, which I honestly haven't thought of in *years*. To make them, I had them printed off on 4x5 photo paper, which I cut the top border off of, and then I baked them in the oven after soaking them in extremely steeped green tea. Turned out weathered and bubbly, just like I wanted.

* Back then your only option for iPhone 4 video was 720p30, but Filmic Pro had just been released and it supported 24p! What a difference! I don't think it had the same granular control we're used to now, but back then being able to dial in another framerate was huge for me. Exposure was all over the place, as you can tell, but it was still the early days and things are a lot easier now. I'm more than a little proud to say that I actually sent the Filmic Pro devs this short so that I could get in the beta test program, and even prouder to know that some of my suggestions made it in to the app over the years. 

* I cut the film in an old version of iMovie for iOS, but the rest of the work was done in GarageBand and the first revision of Final Cut Pro X. The film grain effects are from the Cinegrain packs and I still have a soft spot for those overlays.

I do still shoot my own shorts every now and then, and have continued messing around with iPhone filmmaking by making vlogs while I'm travelling for work. Between now and 2011 the tools have gotten so much better, which is why I'm excited to try something when my 11 Pro eventually arrives! If you actually read through all this, thanks for your time and I hope you get to have some fun with your 11 when it eventually shows up. :)",1568461557.0,1

Perhaps it's just because of the more straightforward naming convention (the whole X / XR / XS thing still confuses people), but I can say that among my circles, 'normal people' seem more interested in the 2019 iPhones than they seemed for the 2018 iPhones last year.

Apps are getting larger update-by-update. How do you manage that?,23,d3vtnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d3vtnf/apps_are_getting_larger_updatebyupdate_how_do_you/,19,"Hi all,

&#x200B;

I've noticed the apps on my iPhone and iPhone are taking up lots of space in storage. They are only getting larger and larger update-by-update.. (and some apps update too often) I even came across a research showing that it's fairly common to see the apps that have increased in size 10 times or more in the last few years.

&#x200B;

I'm now worried about hitting the storage limit shortly without installing anything new or download videos only by updating the apps. 

Apps are currently taking up about 25gb on my iPhone. Would they end up doubling or more after a few years? Are there any way to do some sort of forecast although it would depend on what apps you have.

I believe certain kinds of apps get bulkier quickly than others - social media apps I assume. What other apps grow quickly in size with updates?

Do you guys do anything to manage app taking too much space? I tried delete and re-install to clean up data in the app, e.g. facebook. It does give some space back but the app itself getting larger seems out of control.. Would Apple do something about it..? It's really frustrating to worry about the space all the time..

I ask because my past two phones have both had 256GB storage, and despite having a large and ever-growing photo library, my storage always hovers around the 128GB free mark. So for the past three years, I’ve almost felt gypped because I’m only utilizing half my storage. Seems like Photo Library should utilize more of that free space to cache photos locally.

However, today I was using Lirum Info Lite and noticed that it was reporting only 32GB free. This is more like what I would expect. So is the number in Settings fudged to show how much is “virtually” free?
